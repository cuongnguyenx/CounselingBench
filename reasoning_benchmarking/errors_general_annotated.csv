"Name: Michael Clinical Issues: Separation from primary care givers Diagnostic Category: Anxiety Disorders Provisional Diagnosis: F93.0 Separation Anxiety Disorder Age: 10 Sex Assigned at Birth: Male Gender and Sexual Orientation: Male, Not Assessed Ethnicity: Guatemalan American Marital Status: Not Applicable Modality: Family Therapy Location of Therapy : Agency  ","Michael appears clean and dressed in appropriate clothing. He often fidgets with his hands and insists on sitting next to his father during the session. Speech volume is low, and pace is fast. He has a slightly flattened affect. He exhibits minimal insight consistent with his age.","First session You are a licensed mental health counselor at a pediatric behavioral health center. Michael, a 10-year-old male, presents along with his father. You conduct a thorough psychological exam, including a mental status examination. During the initial interview, you take note of Michael's behavior. He sits very close to his father and looks fearfully around the room. The father tells you Michael has been having trouble at school and home for the past few months and it has been getting worse. When you ask how Michael is doing in school, the father tells you there have been several incidents, including difficulty waking up for school, crying in the morning, and refusal to get dressed and ready. The father also tells you that Michael has been showing signs of frustration with his teachers and classmates. On the home front, the father mentions that his son has become ""a nuisance for his babysitter, especially during bedtime."" Both parents are paramedics on a 24-on/48-off shift rotation. Michael often calls his parents while at work, complaining that he feels sick and cannot fall asleep. He worries that someone might break into the house or that ""something bad will happen"" to his parents. The father reports that he and his wife have tried to reassure Michael, but their efforts have been unsuccessful. They are perplexed as to what is causing Michael's distress. The father tells you that Michael has always been a bright and energetic child, but now he seems overwhelmed and anxious.    You conduct a more detailed interview with Michael alone, focusing on his current environment and daily routines. You ask him how he feels about school, and Michael denies having any issues. He tells you that he does not want to go because his new school is ""boring."" However, when you probe further, he admits to feeling scared and alone. He does not want to be away from his parents, and he imagines ""all the ways they could be hurt"" while they are not with him. You say, ""I can understand why you might be feeling scared and anxious, Michael. It sounds like a lot has been going on recently. I'm here to help you and your parents understand what's causing your worries so you can start to feel better.""    You reconvene with Michael's father and provide a brief summary of your findings. You explain that you suspect Michael's anxiety is likely due to the family's recent relocation and having to adjust to a new school. His fears are also likely rooted in his parents' profession, which may lead him to worry about their safety while they are away from home. You have personal experience in dealing with pediatric anxiety and consider briefly sharing your story with Michael and his parents as you believe it may help them to feel supported and less alone in their struggles, while also providing a practical example of how to work through difficult times. You suggest developing an intervention plan to address Michael's distress and recommend meeting with Michael and his parents for weekly sessions.",The client has experienced a major life change.,"Michael's parents have been married for nine years and both are dedicated to the well-being of their children. The father reports that he and his wife communicate openly with each other and make joint decisions about parenting issues. They also model healthy family dynamics, such as expressing affection and respect towards one another, being honest with one another, and sharing responsibilities. Michael has a five-year-old sister. His father characterizes the family as very close; they do everything together. The father says that he and his wife go to their children's sporting events and school meetings. Every weekend, the four of them are together doing family activities. Except when required to be away due to their work schedules as paramedics, the parents are home with the children at night. Prior to the family's move to a new state 6 months ago, Michael had been a successful student at school, typically performing at or above grade level. He was an active participant in the classroom, often volunteering to answer questions or participate in class discussions. Since the move, however, getting ready for school has been a struggle each day. He is struggling academically; while his grades haven't dropped drastically, he appears to be having trouble focusing and understanding the material. His parents have attended parent-teacher conferences and Michael's teachers have also reported that he seems distracted and uninterested in class. His parents also report that they are having difficulty getting him to stay on task when doing his homework at home.

The correct answer is (C), as Michael's resistance to going to school and being away from his parents is a hallmark symptom of Separation Anxiety Disorder.

The client was referred to receive case management and counseling after experiencing homelessness due to leaving a physically and verbally abusive relationship with her last partner. The client is experiencing the following depressive symptoms: sadness more often than not, mental fogginess, suicidal ideation, insomnia, significant weight loss, feelings of worthlessness, and fatigue. The client experiences PTSD symptoms due to having experienced several abusive relationships, including recurrent distressing intrusive thoughts regarding the physical abuse, distressing dreams related to abuse, and physiological reactions (difficulty breathing, heart racing) when she goes near certain places that remind her of the abuse. She also explains that she has been avoiding triggers, believes that no one can be trusted, has an exaggerated startle response, and has had difficulty experiencing positive emotions. The client says that she does not know if therapy can help because she feels like these events have changed her and that she cannot get back to “normal,” but that she would like to make friends so she doesn’t feel so alone.",Empathize with the client’s thoughts and feelings and encourage cognitive reframing.,"The client comes into the session, sits down, and immediately begins to talk about one of her roommates in the domestic violence home that has been making her angry because the roommate comes into her room when the client is gone and borrows her personal hygiene items. The client continues to explain that she worries that the roommate might come in while she is sleeping, but that she has not done this yet. You process these feelings with the client and identify that when she was a child, her uncle would come into her room without her permission and sexually abuse her. The client also reported that one of her ex-husbands would enter their bedroom drunk at night and would often hit her while she was asleep.

(D): Encourage cognitive reframing in order to guide the client toward your conclusion about her thoughts and beliefs.",B,A," Explanation: The client has experienced trauma and abuse, and it is essential to establish trust and a safe environment. Validating the client's feelings and thoughts is a crucial step in building rapport and creating a non-judgmental space. This approach acknowledges the client's experiences and emotions, which can help her feel heard and understood. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Providing empathy and encouraging cognitive reframing are helpful because these actions validate the client’s experience, even if you do not think that it is rooted in reality, and it provides an opportunity for her to identify other ways to think about the situation. Simply validating the client’s experience does not provide the client with other options about how to feel or think. Challenging beliefs does not validate the client’s experience and may make the client feel unheard or that you do not think she is being rational. Encouraging reframing on its own may put pressure on the client to feel a certain way. Pairing empathy with cognitive reframing is a more holistic approach to supporting the client.",Knowledge Error

The client presents today with her paternal grandmother (PGM), the client’s legal guardian. The PGM states that the client is argumentative, refuses to take responsibility for her actions, and has a tantrum when she receives a consequence for her behavior. She reports that the client is restricted from “every single privilege indefinitely.” The client has been told she can regain privileges once she “learns to act her age.” The client states she is treated unfairly and “blamed for everything” at home and school. The client’s teacher reports that she has difficulty following directions, is easily annoyed by her classmates, and frequently loses her temper. The client’s grades are poor, and she is below grade level in reading. However, she enjoys art and proudly reports that one of her pictures came in 1st place and is hanging in the library.","ODD includes emotional dysregulation, while CD does not.","   ter. F amily History: The client’s paternal grandmother received legal guardianship when the client was in 1st grade due to parental neglect. The client’s mother and father have had ongoing issues with substance abuse. The client’s father is currently incarcerated for drug-related offenses. The PGM reports that the client’s mother continues to “run the streets” and shows up periodically asking for money. The PGM states that the client’s mother abused drugs while pregnant and that the client was born prematurely. In addition, the client’s father had similar school difficulties and dropped out of high school in the 10th grade. History of Condition: The client’s disruptive behavior began in early childhood. When the client was four years old, her tantrums were so severe that she disrupted two daycare placements and was not allowed to return. In kindergarten, the client was given a stimulant by her primary care provider to assist with symptoms of ADHD. The PGM says she is no longer on the medication and believes the client chooses to misbehave, explaining, “she is strong-willed, just like her father.” The client’s school records show she has an individualized education plan (IEP) and receives limited services for developmental delays in reading and written expression",counseling skills and interventions,"intake, assessment, and diagnosis","intake, assessment, and diagnosis","Using the DSM-5-TR criteria, how would you differentiate oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) from conduct disorder (CD)?","(A): ODD includes emotional dysregulation, while CD does not.
(B): ODD includes conflict with authority, while CD does not.
(C): ODD includes destruction of property, while CD does not.
(D): ODD includes cruelty to animals, while CD does not.",A,C," Explanation: According to the DSM-5-TR, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is characterized by a pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness. Conduct Disorder (CD), on the other hand, is characterized by a pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms/rules. The key difference is that CD involves more severe behavior, such as aggression towards people or animals, destruction of property, and serious violations of rules. In this case, the client's behavior is more consistent with ODD, as she displays argumentative and defiant behavior, but there is no indication of more severe behavior characteristic of CD. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).","Criteria for ODD include emotional dysregulation, while CD does not. Both ODD and CD include the criterion of conflict with authority. Only CD includes the destruction of property and cruelty to animals. It is important to distinguish between ODD and CD, and the DSM-5-TR makes that distinction in the differential diagnosis section. The differential diagnosis section can be found after the diagnostic criteria, along with additional text descriptions such as diagnostic features. According to the DSM-5-TR, both conduct disorder and ODD are related to issues of behavior as it relates to conflict with figures of authority, but ODD behaviors are generally less severe than those of conduct disorder and do not target animals or property. Additionally the DSM-5-TR describes ODD to include issues with regulating emotions.",Knowledge Error

His affect is pleasant with emotional lability evident. He demonstrates appropriate insight and judgment, memory, and orientation.  He reports never “seriously” having considered suicide but acknowledges that there were times when he wondered “if dying would make this pain go away.” He has never attempted suicide and states he would never consider harming himself or anyone else.","You are a counselor in a private practice setting.  Your client is a 26-year-old male who presents for counseling at the request of his family and his employer, with whom he is close and who knows his history. The client tells you that he has been angry for the past 15 years, beginning a year after the death of his father from a heart attack. He says that his anger is triggered very quickly when frustrated by people or situations and that his “fuse is very short these days.” He states that he has been in some “loud arguments” with his mother, and later his stepfather. He admits that there have been times in the past when he and his stepfather have “almost come to blows” but his mother stepped in and made them stop. He admits to having hit or kicked walls at times in his anger, but has never hit a person. He tells you that he doesn’t want to feel this way because it interferes with his relationships and his former girlfriends have never understood that when the anniversary of his dad’s death comes around, he just wants to be alone for a couple days and not have to talk to anyone. He tells you that he has never had a long-term relationship with a woman because either he gets “depressed” for a few days during certain times of the year (i.e., father’s birthdate and death date) or because he is too quick to get angry and then says things he doesn’t mean.

He states his dad died of a heart attack while sleeping, so while he did not see it, he knew something had happened because his mother woke him and his siblings and rushed them over to the next door neighbors’ house. He said that his mother went to the hospital with his father in the ambulance and came home that night to tell him and his siblings that their father had died. He tells you that he and his siblings are still very close and that they now have three much younger siblings born after his mother married his stepfather. He says that he is very close to his mother and stepfather, although he lives three hours away from them. He tells you that he tries to get home for big family events, like birthdays. He states that his stepfather adopted him and his siblings after the wedding and the client loves him very much.

While the client has experienced a traumatic event (his father's death), the focus of his treatment should be on managing his anger and improving his relationships. Trauma-focused therapies like TF-CBT, EMDR, and Brain Spotting might be helpful in processing the traumatic event, but they may not directly address the client's anger management issues. Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE) is typically used to treat PTSD symptoms, such as flashbacks and nightmares, which are not the client's primary concerns. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","TF-CBT is not appropriate treatment for this client because TF-CBT is engineered and modeled to be used with children and adolescents who have experienced trauma.

Although she mentions her husband's passing and visiting his grave on his birthday, she has not committed to counseling or grief support groups. Her resistance to feedback and personal questions, as well as her deflection when becoming tearful, suggest that grief is a sensitive topic for her.

Address this with Mary right away as it demonstrates compassion and concern, helps you better understand her feelings and fears, and focuses in on another stressor that could be driving maladaptive behavior. Mary presents as in denial over her shopping patterns which may be driven more by perfectionism, compulsion out of boredom, and lack of life satisfaction more so than addiction. This would require further processing, but Mary does not have insight into this considering her response to your question during session.

He is dressed professionally and appropriately to the circumstances as he tells you he will see clients after your appointment. The client lays on the office couch with his hands behind his head and his feet on a cushion. He answers questions without pauses and often replies very casually with “sure” or “I don’t know,” demonstrating little insight into his thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. He estimates his mood as dissatisfied and unhappy though his affect suggests ambivalence. He presents with some complaints of forgetfulness but is oriented to time and place, and endorses no delusions or hallucinations. He acknowledges frequently feeling suspicious, especially when he’s feeling really stressed. He says he questions other people’s motives and what they are doing or saying when he’s not present. The client acknowledges using alcohol on weekends, and has used marijuana and cocaine regularly over the past ten years but admits it has increased over the last two years.

Your client presents with complaints of not meeting his own expectations in his licensed, health care profession, and dealing with the business aspect of his work, difficulty meeting financial obligations, difficulty getting along with others, and problems with his ability to concentrate. He says his business partner used to be his best friend but now he can’t stand him because he sees the clients more often and leaves your client to do all the work. He tells you his concentration issues have always been present but have become progressively worse over the past eighteen months, as have his feelings of irritability, failure, fatigue, and lately he has pains in his chest and shoulder. He tells you that he thinks sometimes about what would happen if he died, but only as far as wondering how others would react. Later in the session, he says he is not suicidal and does not have a plan, but occasionally he just “gets tired of it all.” He tells you that sometimes he feels like “ending it” and has said that to women when the relationship isn’t going well and once or twice during breakups. He asserts that he has not actually tried to kill himself. He summarizes his relationships with others as “if they like me, they lose interest” and says that he finds himself “almost being manipulative” in how he chooses his words in his relationships with women and sometimes takes them on spontaneous “wildly expensive vacations” so they will not lose interest in him. The client tells you he has been in several relationships with women over the years, beginning with his high school sweetheart, then with his college sweetheart, but none of them have “worked out.” He states he was engaged to his college sweetheart at 24 for 6 months and then she married someone else. He tells you that another girlfriend was married and didn’t tell him, one “went crazy and threatened him with a gun,” and one broke up with him saying that he was “too needy” and “almost obsessive” in wanting to see her every day. He tells you that “all in all, I’m unhappy with how things are going and I need to make changes, but I just have no motivation to do it and I don’t know why I should have to.”","You are angry and feel a physical reaction to my words, but you are still able to tell me how and what you are feeling.","Family History:

He tells you both his maternal and paternal grandfathers were “mean as snakes,” while his paternal grandmother was a “saint.” He reports that one of his uncles committed suicide several years ago and that his cousin, whom he was very close to, committed suicide last year.

(C): Why does that feel uncomfortable for you?
(D): I want to hear how and what you are feeling but I'm uncomfortable when you raise your voice.",A,B," Explanation: None of the options (A), (C), or (D) accurately reflect the client's behavior or the counselor's response during the session. The client did not raise his voice, and the counselor did not express discomfort. The client laid on the couch, answered questions casually, and showed little insight into his thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. Option (B) is a gentle and open-ended question that encourages the client to explore his physical sensations, which is a common technique used in counseling to help clients become more aware of their bodily experiences. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Summarizing the client's feelings and acknowledging that in spite of these, he is able to communicate honestly and openly with you, demonstrates you recognize his progress in addressing his emotions rather than sitting with ambivalence. This opens space for him to see that he can feel and express negative emotions without being abandoned. This will strengthen the therapeutic relationship. Asking him to tell you about the physical reaction changes the focus of the session to the mind-body connection, which is not as important right now as allowing him to express himself and feel safe in the relationship. ""Why"" questions are not used in counseling as they tend to make clients feel defensive. Counselors work to meet clients where they are and while setting boundaries for respect is important, clients often express negative emotions and should not be limited unless the manner of expressing is dangerous or clearly disrespectful to the counselor. In the case of clients with BPD, clients may test the strength of the therapeutic relationship to see if they will be abandoned.","Context Error, Logical Error"

While transporting supplies between bases in a standard jeep convoy, his vehicle triggered an IED explosion or was directly hit by artillery fire. The client was violently jolted and knocked completely unconscious as the blast disabled their jeep.

(D): Immortality vs extinction",D,B," Explanation: Erikson's stages of psychosocial development propose that individuals face specific psychosocial crises at different stages of life. The eighth and final stage, Integrity vs. Despair, typically occurs in late adulthood (65+ years). At this stage, individuals reflect on their lives, and if they feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, they develop integrity. If they feel regret, bitterness, or despair, they may experience despair. Theodore, an 82-year-old, is struggling to cope with the loss of his wife and is experiencing feelings of grief, loneliness, and resistance to change, which are all characteristic of the Integrity vs. Despair stage. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Theodore seems to be in Erikson's stage of Immortality vs. Extinction in which a person is accepting of death and believes that they have led a satisfying and meaningful life. Intimacy vs. isolation occurs around the age of early adulthood when an individual is developing true autonomy from their parents and establishes their own values and ideals. Integrity vs despair occurs in later adulthood when the individual has not yet accepted death but is beginning to develop a point of view about it. Generativity vs. stagnation is a stage that occurs in middle adulthood. Developmental tasks include parenting, nurturing of adult relationships and the management of career and household.The immortality vs. extinction stage was added by Joan Erikson for persons over 75 years of age.",Knowledge Error

Leah is a 37-year-old married woman with a 2-year-old child and is a disabled combat veteran who served 8 years in active-duty Air Force service. Both you and Leah work full-time as mental health counseling interns in your respective practices. Leah struggles to manage her own anxiety which causes both interpersonal and professional problems for her. Leah reports experiencing trauma related to deployments, past divorce, death of a pet and birth trauma with her daughter.

Leah’s biggest problem, she shares, is that she knows how to resolve her negative thoughts that lead her to act impulsively but cannot apply her skills when she feels overwhelmed.",Present the dilemma as only her decision to resolve,"

(B): Re-label her reason for resistance as ""fear""
(C): Review your credentials and experience
(D): Present the dilemma as only her decision to resolve",D,C," Explanation: Leah's skepticism about the therapist's qualifications stems from their similar level of experience. The therapist should address this concern directly by reviewing their credentials and experience, which may help establish trust and credibility with Leah. This approach acknowledges Leah's concerns and may help her feel more comfortable opening up about her trauma experiences. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).","Placing this conflict in Leah's hands empowers her to decide whether she wants to address her trauma with you, discuss other areas only, or see a new professional.

Recall that she has previous abandonment issues from her divorce; perhaps what will help Leah in multiple areas of her personality development is for you to remain in place unless she makes the request for another counselor. Answer b) can be seen as invalidating to her reported concerns or cause her to feel defensive if she is still not respecting your clinical perspective, although can be a good intervention to use once Leah is invested in sharing with you further.

Rick is a senior in high school and lives with his mother and two sisters. Rick does not want to participate in individual or group therapy, but his mother insists that he get help. During the intake, you work to establish rapport with Rick. You also gather information to determine if he is an appropriate candidate for one of the groups you are preparing to start, along with a co-facilitator. You suspect he may have trouble trusting females as he expresses anger when talking about his mother, sister, and ex-girlfriend. Since his father left, Rick says that his mother has been ""in his business"" all the time, and he does not feel like he has any real privacy.    You remain patient with Rick, listening to his story and validating his feelings. You empathize with him, letting him know it is understandable to feel frustrated about not having much privacy. You explain that you are here to help him, not to control him and that you are interested in learning more about him.    You explain to Rick that you are planning to start a group therapy session with a co-facilitator and that you would like to see if it would be a good fit for him. You explain that the group will provide an opportunity for him to talk about his experiences in a safe space with others who may have gone through similar situations In addition, you share that it could be an excellent way for him to practice expressing himself and developing trust in others.    You also explain to Rick that individual therapy sessions could be beneficial in addition to group therapy. You discuss the possibility of one-on-one sessions that would give him a chance to talk more deeply about his experiences in a safe, private setting You emphasize that this could be an excellent way for him to explore his feelings and learn how to cope with them in a healthy way.

The group exhibits high cohesion, and all members participate in group activities. The focus is on continued productivity and problem-solving. You ask the members to reflect on the skills they have been practicing in the group and share an experience in which they have applied those skills outside the session.    Rick's experience in the group has further helped him to identify and understand his feelings. He has been able to recognize his anger and express it in a healthier way. He has also been able to recognize his need for connection. He says he recently called his ex-girlfriend to apologize for being angry about his parents and ""taking it out on her"" by withdrawing from her. This has enabled him to develop a more constructive approach to conflict.    The group members have provided Rick with a safe space to practice his new skills, giving him the confidence to try them in his real-life relationships. The other members have shown Rick support and encouraged him to take risks and to be open to opportunities for growth.    Rick's active engagement in the group has been instrumental in his progress. He has become more aware of his emotions, and he can express himself in a way that is respectful and appropriate. His newfound ability to communicate effectively has been a significant step towards strengthening his relationships both inside and outside of the group.  11th session The group as a whole has made progress, and members have found healthy outlets for expressing their thoughts and feelings. Rick has become more open with the women in the group and seems more receptive to what they have to say. Rick says that his grades have improved, his mother is proud, and he is encouraged by other group members who nod their heads and smile. The group has met its goals. The members have learned strategies to take with them as they prepare for termination. You remind the group that there are only a few more weeks left to meet. You begin to discuss the group members' feelings regarding the end of therapy. Rick starts to cry and says, ""Why does every woman in my life cause problems for me?""    The other group members offer Rick reassurance and empathy, but he continues expressing his frustration and sadness. You encourage the group to reflect on each person's progress and to be mindful of the emotions that this ending brings out. You explain to the group that endings can be difficult and that giving them permission to feel the emotions that arise during this transition is important.    Rick is still struggling with the idea of ending the therapy and expresses his fear of being left alone. He continues to express his feeling that every woman in his life has caused him pain and suffering, and this group's ending has triggered his worst fears. You recognize his fear and attempt to validate his experience by emphasizing his progress in the group and the positive changes he has seen in himself. You explain that the group can support him through the transition and the other members offer encouraging words of encouragement.    Rick is still anxious and overwhelmed. He talks about the difficulty of coping with the loss of the group and how he worries that he won't be able to manage his feelings without the support of the group. You explain to the group that it is natural to feel sadness and loss as well as gratefulness and pride in the progress they have all made. You encourage the group to identify the strategies they have learned in the group that they can use to manage their emotions. Finally, you assure Rick that he can use the skills he has learned in the group to cope with the emotions associated with the end of therapy.","The recorded material must be destroyed, and it is the group members' responsibility to file a complaint.","The client is a first-generation American whose parents immigrated from Korea. He has an old sister who, based on Korean culture, is his superior whom he must obey and be subservient to. His parents have high expectations for him and are very controlling, expecting him to study every night and attend tutoring sessions on the weekend. They have arranged for him to marry a daughter of a prestigious family in Korea after he completes medical school eight years from now, with the intention that he and his wife will live with them and provide financial support. However, this plan has drastically changed.    Seven months ago, the client's father moved out after his mother had an affair. The client became sullen, angry, and withdrawn after this event. Four months ago, while doing laundry, the client's mother saw dried blood on his shirt sleeve. She also noticed that he was wearing long-sleeved shirts all the time. She waited until he was getting dressed, walked in on him, and found he had cuts up and down his arms. The client does not speak to his father much since his parents separated.

The client is a 66-year-old male who is returning to therapy with you. When he called to schedule the appointment, he asked if he could meet with you for dinner beforehand and offered to pay. He presents for his session today, reporting that he has been experiencing what he labels ""anger,"" but he cannot figure out where these feelings are coming from. He says he often talks to himself and ruminates over problems to find solutions. He is seeking your help to improve his relationship with his children. He felt that working with you in the past was helpful, and now that his children are all adults and he is financially secure, he has the time and resources to spend with them.    The client has a history of difficulty in forming and maintaining meaningful relationships, particularly with his children. He has a history of conflict with them and has difficulty with communication and boundaries. He has had difficulty constructively expressing his feelings and has frequently resorted to outbursts of anger and aggression. He has had difficulty positively expressing his needs and has often felt overwhelmed and frustrated by his inability to be heard or understood.    The client also has difficulty with impulse control and self-regulation, contributing to his difficulty managing his anger. He has frequently engaged in self-destructive behaviors to manage these feelings and has had difficulty finding effective coping strategies to control his emotions. He has also reported a pattern of avoidance, in which he avoids or withdraws from difficult situations rather than confront them.    At the end of today's session, the client asks if he can go ahead and schedule therapy appointments with you every Tuesday for the next month so that he is ""guaranteed"" a spot. You can accommodate his request and plan to see him again in one week.  Fourth session The client has been seeing you every Tuesday and likes to schedule his weekly appointments a month in advance. Last week, you asked him to bring in a list of the triggers for his anger and the strategies he has tried in the past to manage it. You explained that this would help you create an individualized treatment plan with specific goals and objectives to work on throughout therapy. Furthermore, you suggested coming up with potential coping strategies to employ if/when he finds himself in a situation in which he feels the need to withdraw or avoid. You also stressed the importance of identifying and addressing any underlying issues contributing to this behavior.    Today, you spend the session exploring his anger and constant road rage, and you help him identify his feelings. He recognizes that the rage comes from a sense of being disrespected and feeling taken advantage of. As you continue that discussion, the client has a revelation.

The client is 9 years old and comes to the first session with his parents. The client has been previously diagnosed with autism via use of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition by a psychologist, and you receive supporting documentation for this diagnosis. The client demonstrates difficulties with normal back-and-forth communication with peers, difficulty maintaining eye contact during the session, and difficulty with imaginative play with peers as reported by his parents. The client and his parents also report what they call “OCD behavior”—for example, he often lines up toys and insists that they “have to be this way”—and that he has trouble with changes in schedule, often becoming aggressive toward the parents if changes occur. The parents report that he is very rigid and that certain activities and play have to be done a certain way or he becomes upset, which affect the home, social, and school settings.

(C): Remind the client that others have different ways of playing and that is okay.
(D): Instruct the client on anger management skills.",C,D," Explanation: The correct answer is (D). While anger management skills are important, they are more of a long-term goal. Given the client's current presentation and the short-term goals, it's more important to focus on teaching the client coping skills to manage frustration and rigidity, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and flexibility in play. Anger management skills can be introduced later as the client develops more self-awareness and self-regulation skills. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","You compiled goals for the client in the first session based on the ASD diagnosis, and you identified the client’s difficulty with imaginative play. This barrier would make understanding that others have different ways of playing difficult for the client and would be the least appropriate intervention in this scenario.

Asking exception questions is a cognitive restructuring technique that helps clients identify exceptions to their negative core beliefs, which can help reduce psychological distress. This technique involves asking the client to think of times when their negative belief was not true, which can help them develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","Cognitive therapists use role reversion to challenge negative cognitions, therefore reducing psychological distress. Role reversion works by instructing clients to switch roles with the counselor and argue against the client’s hypothesis associated with distorted thinking. Shame-attacking exercises are REBT techniques designed to be performed in public to reduce the need for others’ approval. The theory behind shame-attacking exercises is that by reducing the need for approval, there is also a reduction in catastrophic thinking that fosters feelings of inadequacy. Identifying the three basic musts, or irrational beliefs, is an REBT technique. The three basic musts include (1) believing one must perform in a manner that others affirm or else one is void of self-worth, (2) believing one must be treated in a manner that the client finds affirming or else one is labeled “no good,” and (3) believing that one must get what they think they are entitled to or that one’s life is unacceptable.

There is no evidence of suicidal ideation or intent. The client does not express any thoughts of self-harm or harm to others. However, her ongoing feelings of sadness and loneliness warrant close monitoring and support during the therapeutic process.","First session You are a licensed mental health counselor working at a university counseling center and take a humanistic approach in your work with clients. Today you are meeting with an 18-year-old student who recently moved to the United States from Nigeria. She tells you that she moved to the United States one month ago after missionaries in Nigeria granted her a scholarship. She feels lonely, misses her family, and is questioning her decision to come to the United States. She indicates she has never been to therapy before but was told by her academic advisor that it might be helpful to make an appointment with a counselor.    You continue the intake session by exploring the client's current psychological functioning. She expresses that she is homesick and is struggling to find her place in a new environment. She describes having difficulty making friends at college and feels isolated. She does not feel comfortable talking about her personal life with people she does not know well, which makes it even more difficult for her. Additionally, she is struggling with the pressure of living up to the expectations of the members of her church that gave her the scholarship to attend the university. She is currently pursuing a nursing degree at the university. You ask her to share some details about her family and cultural background in order to gain a better understanding of the context of her situation. She tells you that her parents are both teachers and she has two siblings. The family is very close-knit and they typically speak in their native language at home. You also ask about how she is managing her academic obligations, any specific challenges or barriers she might be facing, and how she is spending her free time. She says that her courses are challenging, but she is managing them well. In between classes, she spends most of her time in the library studying.    You discuss the therapeutic process and what she hopes to gain from counseling. She expresses that she would like to learn how to better cope with her homesickness and loneliness. She says, ""I'm worried that I'll be a disappointment. It took a lot of money and effort to get me here, and I don't want to let them down. I was so excited when I first got the scholarship, but maybe it would have been better if it went to someone else."" You validate her feelings and explain that it is natural to feel overwhelmed when faced with a new culture and environment. You further explain the importance of focusing on her strengths, as she has already accomplished so much by making the decision to attend college abroad. You describe therapy as an opportunity for her to explore her feelings, develop coping strategies, and adjust to her new environment. At the end of the session, she tells you she is on a ""tight schedule"" and needs to know when she can see you for therapy so she can plan accordingly. You provide her with your availability and suggest that an ideal therapy schedule would involve weekly sessions. You also explain the importance of consistency in order to allow her to make meaningful progress during therapy. You schedule an appointment for the following week.  Fifth session This is your fifth weekly session with the client, and she states that she likes the ""structure"" of seeing you on Wednesday afternoons. The client appears to be doing better since she last saw you. She begins today's session by telling you that she still feels isolated and is having difficulty making friends. You ask her to elaborate on the challenges she has been facing in connecting with students at the university. She tells you that most of the other international students are from countries closer to America like the Caribbean islands, and it is difficult for her to relate to them. She pauses for a moment and asks if she can tell you about something that happened a few days ago that she is feeling nervous about. You respond affirmatively, and she tells you that her roommate invited her to a party and she ended up drinking which is not something she would normally do. When she and her roommate got back to their dorm room later that night, they kissed. She goes on to say that she thinks she has developed romantic feelings for her female roommate. This experience made her feel confused and anxious, and her family's expectations weigh heavily on her mind. You ask her to elaborate on her feelings in order to gain a better understanding of the situation. The client shares that she is unsure what this could mean for her future and worries if her family will be disappointed in her if they find out. She says, ""I am actually engaged to a man in Nigeria. We decided to postpone the wedding until I finished my degree, but now I don't know what to do. My parents were so excited when we announced our engagement, and the thought of breaking it off feels like a betrayal.""    You explain that it is natural to feel confused when faced with new experiences and remind her that she is in control of the decisions she makes about her life. You suggest exploring what a relationship with her roommate might look like, as well as considering the consequences of breaking off her engagement. She says, ""I know I need to stay true to myself. I just don't want anyone hurt in the process. I can't even imagine what it would mean if I told my parents or church family about my roommate. They are not as conservative as other people in the town where I grew up, but I don't think they know many, if any, people who are in same-sex relationships."" You discuss with the client how her religious and cultural beliefs may affect her sexual identity and contribute to feelings of guilt and fear of disappointing her family.    During the next few weeks following today's session, the client cancels twice without proper notice and later tells you that she ""had other stuff going on.""  Seventh session During today's session, the client tells you that she read a few of the chapters in the book you recommended on human sexuality, and she is starting to feel more comfortable with herself. At your suggestion, she started keeping a journal to organize her thoughts and feelings about her sexuality. She says that she has ""pretty much decided to end my engagement and take some time to explore who I am and what it means to be in a relationship with another woman."" She relates that she still feels homesick at times, but her roommate has been supportive and understanding. She smiles and says, ""My roommate surprised me the other day by cooking a traditional dish that I told her about that my mom used to cook for us growing up. It was so comforting to have a reminder of home like that."" You continue to explore the client's thoughts on telling her parents about her newfound identity, and she says that although the idea of coming out to them and breaking off her engagement is frightening, she knows it is ""the right thing to do."" You provide guidance on how to approach this sensitive subject in a way that may be best received by her family. You also provide additional resources that may help her learn more about navigating conversations around sexuality and sexual orientation with family and friends.

She expresses anxiety and uncertainty about starting anew, but also sees this as an opportunity to find a better fit for her personality. The first focus of this session should be to explore her concerns and feelings about her current situation, which is the loss of her job and her uncertainty about her future. This will help establish a therapeutic rapport and allow the counselor to better understand the client's needs and concerns. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","The client has not mentioned panic attacks previously, so the counselor will need to understand the client's history of panic attacks, including any triggers, symptoms, and how the client has managed her attacks in the past. This will help the counselor and client form a treatment plan to manage the client's stress and any future panic attacks. The counselor should not ask about the client's parents and how she managed that issue. Since the client has not brought it up, the counselor may likely be indulging the counselor's own curiosity, rather than asking for therapeutic reasons. Having the client describe how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed will be addressed in the session as the counselor and client develop treatment strategies for maintaining the client's well-being. Stress and feeling overwhelmed in the moment when embarking on a new venture, such as graduate school, is not abnormal and should not be pathologized. However, because the client states she had a panic attack and has a history of panic attacks, it will be important to address the panic attacks first and then work backwards to feelings of stress. Asking the client why her books triggered a panic attack will not be a helpful question. Panic attacks are triggered by content that may or may not have connection to the actual panic. Asking why the books were a trigger is not important to understanding the panic attack.","Logical Error, Context Error"

She expresses an understanding of her situation and an awareness that her current mental state is not sustainable in the long-term. She has also expressed a desire to seek counseling as a first step towards managing her anxiety.","First session You are a therapist at a community center. The client is a married, 35-year-old mother of two young children. She is a stay-at-home mother, and the family is financially dependent on her husband's income. He works long hours and is very tired when he finally gets home, leaving most of the household tasks and childrearing to the client. She tells you, ""About eight months ago while driving my car, I began having hot flushes, sweating, and feeling like I was going to die. It has happened multiple times since then. What if my kids are with me, and it happens again while I'm driving? I can't stop thinking about it.""

She tells you that she had a ""bad experience"" with medications in the past and wants to try counseling before considering medications again. She expresses feeling afraid that she will never ""get better."" She also states she feels like a ""bad wife and mother"" because she cannot control her anxiety.

She went to the emergency room two days ago with severe dyspnea and fear of dying from a myocardial infarction. Upon arrival at the hospital, the client reported paresthesia, pounding heart, and chest pain. She appears ""frazzled"" and disheveled during today's session. She describes the circumstances leading up to her trip to the hospital. She reports that her husband has been emotionally distant and is becoming increasingly frustrated with her anxiety. Finally, he told her that ""this has been going on long enough"" and that she needed to ""get her act together."" After this conversation, the client experienced a panic attack and stated that she was ""terrified"" that she was dying. Her husband arranged for their neighbor to watch the kids and drive her to the hospital.    You tell the client that she must stop thinking she will die or progress in therapy will be unlikely. You reassure her that the physical sensations she feels during a panic attack are not life-threatening, even though they may feel that way. You discuss the importance of her bringing compassion and attention to her body rather than jumping into ""fight, flight, or freeze"" mode. The client appears anxious and has poor eye contact with an averted gaze. She is continuously wringing her hands together and bouncing her legs. She has trouble concentrating, as evidenced by her asking you to repeat questions. The client tearfully states, ""I'm ruining my family. What if I die? Who will take care of the kids?"" You provide empathy and walk her through a relaxation technique.  Ninth session You have seen the client weekly, and she is progressing. She arrives at today's session on time. She appears calm, alert and focused. She states that she has been actively journaling her thoughts and feelings. This has been helpful for her in identifying themes in her faulty cognitions.

She showed some psychomotor agitation by pulling on the strings of her blouse. The client expressed that she and her husband have been trying to implement a date night which has helped their relationship and for him to better understand what Panic Disorder is. She said that having meaningful conversations with him and having his support in times of panic has helped reduce the attack's length. However, the client did express that she cannot shake the fear of dying and leaving her children.

As she leaves, you see that she has bruises on her arms as she is getting ready to leave and says she was ""roughhousing"" with her husband. You are unsure if she is telling the truth, making you wonder about everything she has been saying about her husband. You discuss with her the option of attending couples therapy to help them work through any issues they may face.

For the past year, the client has reported feeling overwhelmed with the demands of motherhood and home life. She feels that her husband does not understand her struggles, nor does he contribute enough to their household responsibilities. This lack of support from her husband has caused her to feel a deep sense of resentment. She is also concerned that her children are not receiving the support they need from their father, as his involvement in their lives appears to be minimal.    The client expresses frustration with her lack of motivation and has become increasingly more anxious and irritable over the past several months. She reports difficulty concentrating on tasks. She feels her stress levels are rising and she is having recurrent panic attacks. In addition, she has noticed changes in her eating habits, sleeping patterns, and overall mood. These changes have caused the client to worry about managing her responsibilities as a mother. The client has been a full-time stay-at-home mother since the birth of her older child. Before that, she was a salesperson and shift manager at a local women's clothing boutique for several years.

He tells you that he has never had a long-term relationship with a woman because either he gets “depressed” for a few days during certain times of the year (i.e., father’s birthdate and death date) or because he is too quick to get angry and then says things he doesn’t mean.

(B): The effects of trauma can prevent the client from experiencing normal grief.
(C): As the client tries to reduce his anger, his limbic system creates new defense mechanisms.
(D): Trauma is a neurological and emotional reaction and crying is an expected symptom.",C,D," Explanation: The client's sadness and crying are likely related to his unresolved grief and trauma associated with his father's death. The client has been carrying this emotional pain for 15 years, and it has been affecting his relationships and daily life. The statement that best helps the client understand his sadness and crying is the one that acknowledges the connection between his trauma and his emotional response. This statement provides a framework for the client to understand that his emotional pain is a normal response to the traumatic event and that it's not just about his anger. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","The effects of trauma include the development of persistent negative emotional states including fear, guilt, anger, etc., (Criterion D.4) and significant alterations in arousal and reactivity, including angry outbursts with little provocation (Criterion E.1). As the client's symptoms of PTSD subside, he will be better able to connect with normal emotions of grief and loss. PTSD can be associated with MDD, however, the client has described not feeling sad most days, which is a requirement (Criterion A) for an MDD diagnosis. The limbic system is controlled by hormone release and as the client works through his anger, hormones that control ""fight or flight"" such as cortisol, will be released less often into the system inducing normal function, rather than creating new defense mechanisms. While crying can certainly be a reaction to trauma, this client has not experienced that reaction and is reporting crying more now that he is beginning to feel better and less angry. These facts suggest that crying is not a symptom of his PTSD and is occurring as a result of working through his trauma.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

She stayed at home since graduating high school to help her parents with her brother with autism. Her parents had separated on and off for several years because of an affair her mother had, so the house has had tension and instability making Taylor feel responsible to keep her brother on a stable routine. Taylor comments that her brother’s challenges have always “taken up all her time” and that she used to complain about them, but now that he is going to be on his own, she is very upset she will not be able to be there for him.

She wears long sleeves but you notice some scarring on her left wrist when she steeples her hands together in front of her computer screen to answer a question. The client remains alert throughout the interview, though sometimes you have to repeat questions. She seems to be distracted by something off screen at times. She fidgets with a cigarette lighter. The client appears irritable and her affect is labile. The client is coherent. Her speech is unpressured though at times slightly slow. She is oriented to person and place but not time or situation. She is unsure of what day of the week it is and she does not seem to understand the significance of being court-ordered. Her thinking is mostly linear and goal-directed but at times tangential and unfocused. She displays persecutory thought content. Insight and judgment are poor.","First session You are a mental health therapist delivering telehealth therapeutic services. Your 41-year-old Black female client is sitting on her sofa with her arms crossed and an annoyed look on her face. When you first see the client, you are immediately attracted to her as she reminds you of your first wife. She has been mandated to therapy by the Court as part of the terms of her probation. She begins by telling you about her difficulties with her acting career. She recently auditioned for a new role but was turned down because the directors wanted to ""go in a different direction."" She also mentions relationship distress and tells you she has been dating a high-profile plastic surgeon on and off for two years. She tells you, ""We just had a big fight. He said I was 'too high maintenance' and he was tied of 'all my drama' and left. Can you believe it? I was obviously upset and stopped for a drink on the way home and met a very nice gentleman who bought me a few more drinks. But I don't know they think I have a drinking problem.""    As the intake progresses, it becomes evident that the client's frustration and agitation stem from a deep feeling of abandonment. She expresses her distress over feeling overlooked and not validated in her acting career. She reveals her struggle with the expectations placed upon her as a Black woman in the entertainment industry, believing that systemic biases may be limiting her opportunities. This realization amplifies her anger and resentment, fueling her resistance to therapy and perceiving it as a means of forced compliance rather than genuine support.    As you continue to gather information about her presenting problem, you notice that the client is becoming increasingly agitated. Her tone turns angry, and it becomes clear that she resents being in therapy, especially when she says you are ""no more than hired help."" You attempt to ease tensions and build rapport by sharing with her the names of two famous actors you have counseled. However, this does not change her demeanor or attitude toward you.    You detect a recurring theme of self-sabotage that manifests in the client's relationships. She complains about her relationships with the high-profile surgeon and other men. You note the client's lack of trust in men as well as casual female acquaintances who she sometimes sees as ""competition."" Her relationships appear strained due to her unresolved issues, leading to conflicts and feelings of worthlessness. As you continue your assessment, it becomes apparent that a complex interplay of societal pressures, past traumas, and a deep-seated fear of abandonment negatively impacts her self-perception. You also learn that she worries about her precarious financial situation, which adds to her insecurity and instability. The fear of being unable to meet her basic needs is an artifact of her unstable childhood.    You suggest that during the next session, you begin to explore what might be contributing to her current feelings and behaviors beyond just focusing on her career issues, mainly her emotional dysregulation and fears of being abandoned. She says, ""I'm an actress and have auditions. How long is this going to take?"" You reinforce that the client has been court-ordered to therapy and that therapy will continue for as long as it takes to address the mandated objectives in the court order. You schedule a follow-up appointment to meet with the client again next week.",You will need to send documentation of attendance to her probation officer.,"The client shared significant details about her familial history, particularly on her father's side. She conveyed that her paternal relatives have contended with various mood disorders, although she could not provide specific diagnostic categories. As a result of her father's authoritarian parenting style of strict adherence to his rules and restrictions, she has rejected any limitations from any authority figures.    Notably, she also revealed several severe distressing incidents within her family, including suicide attempts, multiple instances of divorce, and hospital admissions. According to the client, these incidents often emerged due to relational difficulties, culminating in elevated levels of emotional distress.    Furthermore, the client reported a history of hospitalization, although her recollection of the admission circumstances was somewhat nebulous. She said that she was feeling ""distraught"" during that period. You determine that exploring this episode more thoroughly in future sessions when the client feels ready and comfortable could provide valuable insights into her emotional coping mechanisms and resilience.  The client was recently arrested for driving under the influence (DUI). This was not her first encounter with law enforcement regarding such a matter, as she has been charged with three DUIs over the past five years. However, this recent incident was markedly different and considerably more severe. She lost control of her vehicle and collided with a residential building, resulting in physical injury to a child. She underwent legal proceedings after her involvement in this accident and was found guilty. As part of her sentence, she was placed on probation under the court's oversight and mandated to attend therapy. The client disclosed that her consumption of alcohol is primarily social in nature.

Your 60-year-old male client comes into the intake session, sits down, and sighs deeply. You verbally acknowledge that the client looks as though he is carrying a big mental weight, and he nods. The client begins to talk about how he was let go from his job at an assembly plant a month prior due to budget cuts. The client says that he worked there for about 30 years and that he was most recently a plant manager for the past 10 years. The client states that the plant shut down because the automotive company moved their manufacturing to another country. The client expresses anxiety surrounding what he is going to do for work next. The client states that he worries that he does not have much to offer other employers due to the extent of time he spent at his last job and also that his age will make him unemployable.

(C): Turning your body 45 degrees away from the client to minimize a seemingly aggressive body posture
(D): Saying “yes,” “right,” and “uh huh” or using head nods to show that you are listening",A,D," Explanation: A positive attending trait for a therapist is to use verbal and nonverbal cues to show that they are actively listening and engaged with the client. Saying ""yes,"" ""right,"" and ""uh huh"" or using head nods are examples of verbal and nonverbal cues that demonstrate active listening and engagement. This helps the client feel heard, understood, and validated. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","Speaking in a slow, soft, gentle tone can encourage thought and engagement from the client and is a positive attending trait that can be used by the therapist (Sommers-Flanagan & Sommers-Flanagan, 2015, p. 64). Using hand gestures and frequently stating “yes” or “uh huh” along with head nods can interrupt the client by making them think that you have more to say, or it may make them avoid eye contact in order to avoid the distraction of seeing frequent head nodding (Sommers-Flanagan & Sommers-Flanagan, p. 65).

Next, you ask the client to explain and his mother to share with you why they came to see you today and what their expectations are for therapy.

You ask the mother to take a seat in the waiting room while you speak with her son for the first part of the session. She reluctantly agrees and leaves the room.    Once the mother leaves, you start by letting the client know that you understand that this situation is difficult, and that you are here to help.

As you prepare for his appointment, you hear yelling in the waiting room and find Gregory screaming at his mother. She is sitting in the chair, shaking her head. You call them both into your office. His mother yells, ""I've had enough of you today! This time, I'm going to talk!"" Gregory rolls his eyes and mocks her. According to his mother, Gregory was ""caught by the school resource officer today with a vape on him."" She chokes back tears, saying, ""I don't know who my son is anymore."" Gregory responds, ""You're overreacting. That's all you do. Big deal. It's just a vape. Get over it."" His mother looks at you and says, ""He's not getting better even with therapy. He won't listen to anyone, and dealing with him is a constant pain. He's spiteful and working against me. How do I get my son back?""    Gregory has been exhibiting increasingly concerning behaviors since he began using a vape. He has become easily frustrated, struggles to regulate his emotions, and often resorts to aggressive outbursts. He continues to be defiant and uncooperative, straining his relationship with his mother.

He often fidgets with his hands and insists on sitting next to his father during the session. Speech volume is low, and pace is fast. He has a slightly flattened affect. He exhibits minimal insight consistent with his age.","First session You are a licensed mental health counselor at a pediatric behavioral health center. Michael, a 10-year-old male, presents along with his father. You conduct a thorough psychological exam, including a mental status examination. During the initial interview, you take note of Michael's behavior. He sits very close to his father and looks fearfully around the room. The father tells you Michael has been having trouble at school and home for the past few months and it has been getting worse. When you ask how Michael is doing in school, the father tells you there have been several incidents, including difficulty waking up for school, crying in the morning, and refusal to get dressed and ready. The father also tells you that Michael has been showing signs of frustration with his teachers and classmates. On the home front, the father mentions that his son has become ""a nuisance for his babysitter, especially during bedtime."" Both parents are paramedics on a 24-on/48-off shift rotation. Michael often calls his parents while at work, complaining that he feels sick and cannot fall asleep. He worries that someone might break into the house or that ""something bad will happen"" to his parents. The father reports that he and his wife have tried to reassure Michael, but their efforts have been unsuccessful. They are perplexed as to what is causing Michael's distress. The father tells you that Michael has always been a bright and energetic child, but now he seems overwhelmed and anxious.    You conduct a more detailed interview with Michael alone, focusing on his current environment and daily routines. You ask him how he feels about school, and Michael denies having any issues. He tells you that he does not want to go because his new school is ""boring."" However, when you probe further, he admits to feeling scared and alone. He does not want to be away from his parents, and he imagines ""all the ways they could be hurt"" while they are not with him. You say, ""I can understand why you might be feeling scared and anxious, Michael. It sounds like a lot has been going on recently. I'm here to help you and your parents understand what's causing your worries so you can start to feel better.""    You reconvene with Michael's father and provide a brief summary of your findings. You explain that you suspect Michael's anxiety is likely due to the family's recent relocation and having to adjust to a new school. His fears are also likely rooted in his parents' profession, which may lead him to worry about their safety while they are away from home. You have personal experience in dealing with pediatric anxiety and consider briefly sharing your story with Michael and his parents as you believe it may help them to feel supported and less alone in their struggles, while also providing a practical example of how to work through difficult times. You suggest developing an intervention plan to address Michael's distress and recommend meeting with Michael and his parents for weekly sessions.  Fourth session When you arrive at your office today, you realize that you inadvertently left therapy notes on your desk after work on Friday, which included information about Michael's case, and the notes are not where you left them. The weekend cleaning crew lets you know that the notes were discarded in the trash. You take the appropriate action in managing this breach of confidentiality, following your practice's guidelines and policies. You also take time to reflect on how this incident could have been prevented and use it as a learning opportunity for yourself.    When you met with Michael and his parents during the previous two sessions, you gathered additional information about his symptoms, thoughts, and feelings. You provided psychoeducation about separation anxiety and recommended that Michael's parents make an appointment for him to see his pediatrician. You also began to formulate a treatment plan with the overall goal of tolerating separation from his parents without severe distress.    Michael and his parents present for today's session on time. The parents begin by reporting that their son's symptoms continue to be a problem. School refusal is still an issue. His mother has had to come home from work three times this past week. His outbursts were so loud that the neighbors came by to check on him. The mother says, ""My boss has been patient with me so far, but pretty soon, I'm going to be at risk of losing my job if we can't get a handle on our son's behavior. What are we doing wrong?"" Your focus during this session is on helping the parents understand their role in the therapy process. You start by reviewing some of the psychoeducation you provided in prior sessions, focusing on the importance of consistency in parenting approaches and providing structure for Michael at home. You discuss different strategies they can use at home to help build their son's coping skills. You also provide some relaxation exercises that Michael can do when he feels anxious.    At the end of the session, you thank Michael and his parents for coming in today and assure them that they are on the right track. You take time to summarize the key points of the session and emphasize the importance of follow-through with what was discussed in order for progress to be made. You provide them with resources to further support their efforts and suggest a follow-up appointment in one week.  Tenth session You have been working with Michael to develop and practice effective coping skills appropriate to his age. You have been using behavioral modification techniques to decrease his anxiety about being away from his parents. During previous sessions, you suggested that his parents leave your office space for progressively more extended periods. Michael has complied with these requests, although he was initially anxious and agitated. After five weeks, he is now able to tolerate being away from his parents for up to an hour. In today's session, the parents reflect on their son's progress since he started therapy. They believe that he has made a significant improvement. To date, there have only been ""little incidents."" The parents report that two days ago, Michael was reluctant to go to bed without them and had a minor fit. Instead of escalating the situation, they calmly reminded him of the strategies he had learned in therapy such as taking deep breaths when feeling anxious. To their surprise, Michael began using his coping skills and went to bed peacefully. Michael's mother tells you, ""It finally feels like we've turned a corner. I'm so proud of him!"" The parents have also received positive updates from Michael's teachers who say that he is doing much better in school. They report that he has made a new friend and was invited to a sleepover. Michael seems excited about the idea. His parents are not sure how he will handle being away from home overnight, but they are willing to try.    After providing you with an update, the parents leave the room to wait in the waiting room while you talk to Michael. He appears receptive and comfortable with this arrangement. He tells you, ""I kind of feel dumb for being scared. I'm sorry for causing so much trouble."" You respond affirmatively and validate his feelings. Next, you say, ""I remember when you first came to my office with your mom and dad. You were having a lot of trouble being away from them. Do you think that's still a problem for you?"" He shakes his head ""No"" and reports that he is now able to be away from his parents for longer periods of time without feeling scared or upset. You ask him what has been most helpful to him when he starts to feel anxious. He says, ""The counting and breathing stuff you showed me how to do. Also, I think about something fun that I did with my mom and dad, like that time we went to the beach and built a giant sandcastle!"" You tell him how proud you are of his progress and encourage him to keep using the coping strategies he has learned in therapy.    Near the end of the session, you invite Michael's parents back into your office to check in with them about next steps. The parents agree that Michael has made significant progress in tolerating separation and they feel that the treatment has been successful. You offer additional resources for follow-up care and suggest a plan for transitioning out of therapy. Lastly, you thank Michael and his parents for their dedication throughout the course of therapy and let them know that you are available if they have any further questions or concerns.","""It's understandable to feel scared in new or unfamiliar situations. It takes a lot of courage to face your fears and overcome them.""","Michael's parents have been married for nine years and both are dedicated to the well-being of their children. The father reports that he and his wife communicate openly with each other and make joint decisions about parenting issues. They also model healthy family dynamics, such as expressing affection and respect towards one another, being honest with one another, and sharing responsibilities. Michael has a five-year-old sister. His father characterizes the family as very close; they do everything together. The father says that he and his wife go to their children's sporting events and school meetings. Every weekend, the four of them are together doing family activities. Except when required to be away due to their work schedules as paramedics, the parents are home with the children at night. Prior to the family's move to a new state 6 months ago, Michael had been a successful student at school, typically performing at or above grade level. He was an active participant in the classroom, often volunteering to answer questions or participate in class discussions. Since the move, however, getting ready for school has been a struggle each day. He is struggling academically; while his grades haven't dropped drastically, he appears to be having trouble focusing and understanding the material. His parents have attended parent-teacher conferences and Michael's teachers have also reported that he seems distracted and uninterested in class. His parents also report that they are having difficulty getting him to stay on task when doing his homework at home.

The 54-year-old male client is currently living in a tent in the woods behind a local grocery store and reports that he lost his job a year ago following a divorce from his wife of 26 years. The client stated that about 3 years ago he had a back injury and following surgery was prescribed oxycodone. The client continued that he had difficulty stopping his use of the medication when the prescription ran out and connected with a friend to get fentanyl. He reports that he spends a lot of time on a street corner asking for money to get fentanyl and that he cannot seem to go a day without it. The client feels that he cannot sleep or function without the use of fentanyl and that this has affected his housing, marriage, employment, and social life.

(D): Generalization",D,A," Explanation: The client's statement ""I don't see how things will improve because things have been bad for so long"" reflects a negative and hopeless outlook on the future, assuming that because things have been bad in the past, they will continue to be bad. This type of thinking pattern is characterized as catastrophizing, which involves exaggerating the negative consequences of a situation. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Generalization involves taking a situation, such as the client’s recent history, and assuming that the future will be the same. Catastrophizing involves thinking the worst-case scenario will happen. Although the client thinks things will not improve, he isn’t focused on the worst-case scenario. Rather, he is experiencing hopelessness that things will ever be different. Black-and-white thinking means thinking things have to be either perfect or a complete failure. Although the client worries about things being the same, he is not focused on two extreme outcomes, but on the continuation of his situation.

A secure attachment style is when a child feels comfortable enough to communicate wants and needs, knows that their caregiver has their interest and safety in mind, is independent, and has good self-esteem. An avoidant, or dismissive, attachment style is characterized by insecurity, independence, a desire for intimacy but a fear of it, and the placement of distance between the self and others.

She reports that she has three close female relatives with breast cancer, but no relapses after treatment. She states that she has been in a relationship with her partner for 17 years and they share two children, ages 12 and 8. She describes her partner as a “good person” and the relationship as “good.” She tells you that they moved to the area one year ago when her partner had an unexpected promotion. She reports this has been good but that their oldest child is “anxious, emotional, and just angry sometimes.”",treatment planning,counseling skills and interventions,counseling skills and interventions,Which of the following interventions would be the most effective for helping the client and her partner develop better communication skills at home?,"(A): Provide a list of ideas that the client and her partner can use to ask for help from each other
(B): Have the client and her partner develop a list of practice topics for asking for help
(C): Identify which areas the client has the most difficulty asking for help
(D): Role play having the client's partner clarify whether the client is asking for help",C,B," Explanation: The client has been hesitant to discuss her concerns and emotional fears with her partner, fearing that she needs to ""protect her from my negativity."" This indicates a lack of open communication and a need for the client and her partner to develop better communication skills. By having the client and her partner develop a list of practice topics for asking for help, they can work together to identify specific areas where the client needs support and practice asking for it in a safe and controlled environment. This can help them build confidence in communicating their needs and improve their relationship. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Identifying which areas the client struggles with in asking for help will guide the counselor and client to focus on the emotions that surround these specific situations. This allows the client and her partner to be aware that these trouble spots are important and need more attention when communicating. The counselor and client then can practice role-playing examples of these situations. Having the counselor provide, or the client and her partner develop, a list for practice topics is likely to include more superficial topics since these are seen as practice opportunities. No evidence has been shown that the client struggles to ask for help except with her cancer journey and its impact on the couple's intimacy. Having the counselor roleplay with the client's partner puts the partner in the position to have to ""pull out"" what the client is really asking for, rather than helping the client communicate her needs more openly.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

(B): Discuss limits of confidentiality
(C): Review Carlos' successes and strengths
(D): Assess competency to provide informed consent",D,A," Explanation: At this initial intake, the counselor's priority is to establish a rapport with Carlos and his mother, understand the reasons for referral, and begin to identify patterns and reasons for Carlos' behaviors. While reviewing Carlos' successes and strengths (C) is important, it is not the most pressing issue at this stage. Assessing competency to provide informed consent (D) is also important, but it may not be relevant for a 12-year-old who is accompanied by his mother. Discussing limits of confidentiality (B) is crucial, especially in a court-mandated referral, to ensure that Carlos and his mother understand the boundaries of the counseling relationship. However, the most important issue to address initially is clarifying the counselor's role and managing expectations (A), as Claudia seems to have unrealistic expectations about the counselor's ability to ""fix"" Carlos. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","There is no indication that Carlos and his mother are not capable of providing informed consent. It is important to address Claudia's commend about ""fixing"" Carlos. This can be incorporated in the informed consent process. Also, discussing confidentiality and the limits of confidentiality when you are treating a minor is imperative. Given Carlos' response, reviewing his successes and strengths will not only help his mother focus on the positive but it can also be a way to engage Carlos.",Logical Error

(D): Drug and Alcohol Screening (DAS)",B,A," Explanation: The client has not mentioned any substance use or abuse issues. She has mentioned taking birth control and antidepressants in the past, but there is no indication of current substance use. Therefore, it is not necessary to assess her substance use at this point. The focus should be on understanding her marital relationship, anxiety, and worry. Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above). Note: The options provided do not seem to be relevant to the client's presenting issues. 
","The DAST is a drug screening tool that does not include screening for alcohol. Since the MAST has already screened for alcohol use, it is important to screen for other substances.

(B): Refer client to psychiatry for medication evaluation
(C): Refer client to a professional organizer who can help organize the client's home
(D): Refer client to behavioral health to determine client's competency to make decisions",B,C," Explanation: Based on the client's presentation, it is clear that she is struggling with hoarding disorder, as evidenced by her accumulation of numerous items on her property, including vehicles, carports, and flea market items, which she believes may ""come in handy"" at some point. Given this, a referral to a professional organizer who can help her organize her home and develop strategies for managing her belongings would be the most helpful in treating her hoarding disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).","Referring the client to psychiatry will be most helpful for treating the client's hoarding disorder due to the components of depression, OCD, and ADHD that are often co-occurring with hoarding disorder. Treatment with SSRIs is helpful in treating those with hoarding disorder. Referring to a professional organizer will not be adequate, although once the client has made gains through therapy, teaming a counselor with a professional organizer who is trained to work with hoarding disorders may be helpful. While hoarding disorders may include difficulty with decision-making, the client does not demonstrate incompetence and referral for evaluation or declaration of incompetence would be inappropriate.

However, the counselor must still adhere to ethical standards of disclosure. The most ethical level of disclosure would be to provide information on treatment participation and progress (B), as this would allow the PCP to have a general understanding of the client's engagement in treatment without disclosing sensitive or confidential information. This level of disclosure is necessary for the PCP to coordinate care and provide comprehensive treatment.

Her overall demeanor was reserved, displaying noticeable nervousness and a tendency to withdraw from interactions. Upon conversing with her, it became evident that her train of thought often deviated from the topic at hand, hinting at a tangential pattern. This difficulty in maintaining concentration appears to be a consequence of her heightened anxiety levels. Delving deeper into her thought content, a recurring theme of obsessions surrounding food and body weight emerged. Additionally, a palpable fear of judgment from her peers and the broader society was evident. In terms of her cognitive functioning, she was found to be alert and fully oriented to her personal details, as well as her current location and time. However, a significant concern is her limited insight into her present circumstances and the implications of her behaviors. Throughout the assessment, there were no indications of any memory impairments.","First session You are a mental health therapist working in a university counseling center. The client, a 21-year-old female, presents issues related to anxiety, poor body image, and eating. You begin the session by introducing yourself and explaining your role as a therapist. You also explain how confidentiality is handled and make sure that she understands her rights as a client. After the initial introductions, you ask her to tell you about her current situation and what led her to seek out therapy. She reports that she has been feeling anxious for a while, but it has gotten worse since a basketball game when someone in the audience yelled to the referee ""thunder thighs over there needs to get her act together!"" Even though the comment was not directed at her, she internalized it. She explains that she was already feeling uneasy due to her stepfather's comments about her weight from a few years ago, and the recent insult at the game made it ""all come crashing down"" for her. Now, she cannot stop ruminating about her appearance. She saw a poster in her dorm room promoting counseling services and decided to make an appointment.    You continue your interview by asking about her current eating behaviors. She explains that she avoids carbohydrates, sugar, and most dairy ""since that stuff makes you fat."" When you ask her to describe what she eats during a typical day, she says, ""I usually have a fruit smoothie with almond milk for breakfast, an apple and 12 nuts for lunch, and then some steamed vegetables or a salad for dinner."" When asked about exercise or other physical activity besides basketball, she reports that she runs at least seven miles on a nearby trail every morning and spends two hours swimming laps at the indoor gymnasium pool every evening before bed. She says, ""The pool is pretty quiet at night. I don't like to be around a lot of people when I'm exercising.""    As you continue your dialogue, you ask the client open-ended questions to explore her relationship with her parents, especially her stepfather. She reports that her stepfather has always had negative remarks about her size and shape. She states that she feels like he views her as ""less-than"" because of her weight, which has led to feelings of shame and worthlessness. You explore the dynamic further by inquiring about how these comments have impacted her self-esteem. She reports feeling anxious, embarrassed, and inadequate when her stepfather is critical. You validate her feelings and explain that comments like these can be very damaging to a person's self-image.    You ask the client what she hopes to accomplish in therapy. After some thought, the client says that she wants to learn how to manage her anxiety. She looks at your shyly and says, ""I also want to be able to eat a piece of chocolate. I know that sounds crazy, but I just want to be able to enjoy it, without feeling guilty or like I'm going to get fat."" You affirm her desires and explain that a key part of the therapeutic process will be to help her build self-confidence and develop healthier relationships with food.  Sixth session You have been working with the client in intensive outpatient therapy and have been meeting with her two times per week. She is under medical care at the university's health center and has started taking an anti-anxiety medication that was prescribed by her physician. You have also referred her to a nutritionist for specialized guidance on developing a healthier relationship with food. You have established a strong, trusting relationship, and she has told you that she feels comfortable talking to you.    Today, the client brings up an issue that has been bothering her for a while: anxiety about eating around other people. She tells you that she usually gets her food ""to go"" from the cafeteria and eats at a bench outside or alone in her dorm room. She avoids eating in front of others when possible. However, at least once or twice a week, her teammates all go out to lunch after practice. This usually requires her to order food in front of them and she feels very anxious about it. She has been ordering the same salad with dressing ""on the side"" for several months because that is what makes her feel the most comfortable. One of her teammates commented on her ""same old salad"" and asked why she never got anything else to eat. Everyone at the table got quiet and turned to look at her. The client reports that the comment made her feel embarrassed and ashamed, like everyone was laughing at her. You ask her how she responded in the moment and she shares that she just laughed it off, but internally, she felt very embarrassed and anxious. You explore this further by asking her what emotions arise when she is around food, particularly in social settings. She reports feeling ashamed for wanting to eat ""fattening food"" because of her father's comments about her size. She skipped the last team lunch because she was so anxious about someone drawing attention to her food choices again. She closes her eyes and takes a breath. When she opens her eyes, you can see that she is struggling to hold back tears. She says, ""Everyone eats their food like it's no big deal. But it's a huge deal for me. It's all I can think about. I just want to be able to eat a meal without feeling guilty or like I'm going to get fat. I'm so tired of worrying about food all the time!""    You consider using exposure and response prevention techniques to address her fear and anxiety related to eating. You continue the session by identifying a list of foods and situations that trigger her anxiety and negative feelings about her body. You ask the client if she would like to meet with you for her next session right after practice and bring a lunch to eat in your office. She appears relieved and grateful to have a break from eating in front of her teammates.  10th session During your last session with the client, she discussed the anxiety that she was feeling about going home for winter break in a few weeks. She told you that her mom and stepdad always prepare a large meal for the holidays, and the extended family members get together to eat. She expressed a desire to participate in the family festivities but concern about her mom and stepdad's lack of understanding about her illness. She told you, ""I don't want to make anyone feel bad, but I just can't eat like everyone else. It's not only the food - it's the conversations and comments about my body that really bother me."" You listened as she expressed her fear of disappointing her family and reassured her that is was okay to set boundaries and have conversations about food. Together, you brainstormed coping strategies to manage her anxiety. You also suggested that she bring a dish of food that she would be comfortable eating to the winter break gathering. At the end of the session, she asked if she could bring her parents to the next session in an effort to gain their support and to help them understand what she is going through. You agreed to her request and scheduled an appointment to meet with the client and her parents.    At the start of today's session, you introduce yourself to her parents and explain your role in helping their daughter. The client's mother tearfully shares that she had no idea her daughter was struggling so much and that she wishes she had picked up on the signs sooner. The stepfather appears quiet and reserved. You help guide a conversation between the client and her parents about her eating disorder and symptoms that she is experiencing. The client shares her fears, triggers, and struggles around food. Her stepfather speaks up and says, ""I've heard enough. This is just ridiculous. You should just be able to eat, like everyone else. Your generation has gone 'soft' and started making up problems. There are people out there who don't have any food. When I was growing up, we had nothing. Your behavior is disrespectful."" As he is talking, the client's mother is quiet and visibly uncomfortable. The client interjects, ""Are you kidding? I'm the one who's being disrespectful?"" She looks toward you and says, ""When I'm home, he cooks these extravagant meals and refuses to let me leave the table until I've eaten what he's served me because it's 'wasteful to throw away food.' It's abuse! I feel like a captive when I'm at home."" She looks back at her stepfather and says, ""All I'm asking is that you understand what I'm going through and try to be a little more supportive."" The stepfather's face turns red with anger, and he gets up to leave the room. You intervene and ask him to stay, offering a suggestion that you all take a few moments to reflect on what each person has shared before continuing the conversation. While the stepfather takes a break, you encourage the mother to open up and express her feelings.

She states she is secretive when bingeing and feels “disgusted” afterward but “completely unable” to stop the compulsion. The client reports binge eating six times per week, with episodes worsening in the last two years. She identifies as bisexual and reports her binge eating increased after coming out to her family.

(B): Microinvalidation
(C): Microassault
(D): Microinjury",A,B," Explanation: Microaggressions are subtle, often unintentional expressions of bias or prejudice. In this case, the statement ""There's no way I'd go out with someone who is bisexual. They'd eventually leave me for someone from the opposite sex"" is an example of microinvalidation. Microinvalidation involves denying, minimizing, or invalidating the experiences of a marginalized group, in this case, bisexual individuals. The statement implies that bisexual people are untrustworthy and will inevitably leave their partners for someone of the opposite sex, which is a harmful and invalidating stereotype. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","There are three types of microaggressions: microinsults, microinvalidations, and microassaults. Microinsults are behaviors or comments that are not meant to be discriminatory and generally stem from a lack of awareness and/or reliance on stereotypes. Researchers show that microaggressions are usually cumulative and detrimental to the health and well-being of those who experience them. It is not uncommon for individuals who identify as bisexual to experience biphobia within LGBTQ communities. Microinvalidations occur when comments or experiences are dismissed or seen as irrelevant. Microinvalidations often stem from heterosexism. An example of a microinvalidation would be to assume a married female has a husband. Microassaults are intentionally discriminatory and include purposeful acts of insensitivity, rudeness, and intolerance. Microinjury is not identified as a microaggression.",Logical Error

Melanie has been in mental health counseling for several years through your agency and was referred to you by her last counselor who obtained a position with a local University and was leaving your company. Melanie is a 32-year-old Caucasian female who lives in a house with her boyfriend and her 9-year-old son, Gus, who suffers from ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD. Melanie is receiving psychiatric medication from your agency’s Psychiatrist, another Psychiatric practice by a Nurse Practitioner in a different city and is being treated medically by a Gastroenterologist who has also prescribed medications. Melanie is complaining of ongoing depression caused by her chronic nausea and a cyclic vomiting syndrome and does not want to leave her bed out of helplessness and hopelessness that nothing will ever change.

(C): Discuss planning a conference call with all her providers to coordinate her care
(D): You do not need any of this information",A,B," Explanation: To effectively plan treatment for Melanie, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of her current medications and their effects on her cognitive state. Requesting documentation from her outside providers through a Release of Information is the most appropriate approach, as it will provide accurate and detailed information about her medications. This will enable the therapist to better understand Melanie's cognitive state and develop a more informed treatment plan. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Simply asking Melanie to share with you the medications she is on and how she is reacting with them is sufficient at this phase of the counseling relationship. The information Melanie can provide will support your understanding of how these medications might be interacting, affecting her diagnosable conditions and helpful for you to be following up with her on maintaining them if you notice any cognitive or behavioral changes. Should you require the medical documentation at some point in your course of care for her, having her sign a release of information with her provider prior to your request will be expected. Discussing Melanie's treatment with all her providers at the same time is highly unlikely to occur and is not necessary. As a counselor you may feel at the time that knowing Melanie's medication list is not important or unnecessary, however medication management is a key component of mental health wellness, and you could be missing vital information about treating your clients without it.","Logical Error, Practicality"

His mother reports that her son has been struggling in school and has been the target of bullying. She tells you that he recently started at a new school after their neighborhood was re-zoned. The bullying started a few weeks ago when he was sitting alone in class during lunch. A group of boys, whom Logan had never seen before, sat beside him and began teasing him about his clothes, shoes, and hair. When Logan tried to ignore them, they started calling him names. He went home that day feeling embarrassed and alone. Since then, the boys have devised new ways to make fun of Logan. They sneak behind him in the hallways, push him around when the teacher is not looking, and push him into the bathroom.    Logan has been refusing to go to school, saying he has stomach aches. His mother says, ""He used to love school. He even loved doing his homework. How many parents are lucky enough to have a child who likes doing homework?"" When questioned, Logan says that he now hates school and wants to be home-schooled. He says he is being bullied throughout the day, and it does not stop until he leaves the bus. Logan's mother has been worried about him and wants to know how to stop the bullying. At first, she thought it was just ""kids being kids"" when they tease each other, but she is now concerned that it has gone too far. She also asks if you can help him to make friends in his new school.    During today's session, you notice that Logan appears anxious and withdrawn. As you gently probe further, Logan shares that he feels overwhelmed by the constant bullying, which has begun to affect his self-esteem. You observe that he appears hesitant to discuss the specifics of his experiences, suggesting that he may fear rejection by you or be embarrassed by what was done to him. This indicates that the situation has caused significant distress and has started to erode his resilience.    As you explore Logan's support network, he hesitantly reveals that he has been unable to make new friends since starting at the new school. The fear of being targeted by bullies has made it challenging for him to approach other students or engage in extracurricular activities. Consequently, Logan feels increasingly isolated and struggles to see a way out of his current situation. This lack of social connection exacerbates his feelings of loneliness and despair. As part of his treatment plan, you include developing and maintaining positive relationships with peers to work on his tendency to isolate himself.    Toward the end of the session, Logan's mother inquires about possible strategies to address the bullying. You acknowledge her concerns and emphasize the importance of a collaborative approach involving the school, family, and community. You suggest initiating communication with Logan's teachers and school administrators to create a safe and supportive environment for him.

You can then explore ways to address the bullying and help Logan develop coping strategies and build his self-esteem, which will ultimately help him make friends at school. Providing empathy and understanding sets the tone for a collaborative approach and helps build trust with the client and his mother. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Explanation: As a school therapist, it is important to emphasize that you are not in a position to help Logan directly make friends at the new school.

It is used to screen individuals to identify those who need a more comprehensive evaluation. The WAIS-IV and WISC-V are both intelligence assessments that will identify if the client has a deficit in some area of intellectual functioning. The WAIS-IV tests from age 16 to adult and the WISC-V tests children up to and including age 16, so either of these may be helpful. The KABC-II tests for both achievement and intelligence and also can help in identifying learning disabilities so this will be a helpful test with this client.",Logical Error

Her overall demeanor was reserved, displaying noticeable nervousness and a tendency to withdraw from interactions. Upon conversing with her, it became evident that her train of thought often deviated from the topic at hand, hinting at a tangential pattern. This difficulty in maintaining concentration appears to be a consequence of her heightened anxiety levels. Delving deeper into her thought content, a recurring theme of obsessions surrounding food and body weight emerged. Additionally, a palpable fear of judgment from her peers and the broader society was evident. In terms of her cognitive functioning, she was found to be alert and fully oriented to her personal details, as well as her current location and time. However, a significant concern is her limited insight into her present circumstances and the implications of her behaviors. Throughout the assessment, there were no indications of any memory impairments.","First session You are a mental health therapist working in a university counseling center. The client, a 21-year-old female, presents issues related to anxiety, poor body image, and eating. You begin the session by introducing yourself and explaining your role as a therapist. You also explain how confidentiality is handled and make sure that she understands her rights as a client. After the initial introductions, you ask her to tell you about her current situation and what led her to seek out therapy. She reports that she has been feeling anxious for a while, but it has gotten worse since a basketball game when someone in the audience yelled to the referee ""thunder thighs over there needs to get her act together!"" Even though the comment was not directed at her, she internalized it. She explains that she was already feeling uneasy due to her stepfather's comments about her weight from a few years ago, and the recent insult at the game made it ""all come crashing down"" for her. Now, she cannot stop ruminating about her appearance. She saw a poster in her dorm room promoting counseling services and decided to make an appointment.    You continue your interview by asking about her current eating behaviors. She explains that she avoids carbohydrates, sugar, and most dairy ""since that stuff makes you fat."" When you ask her to describe what she eats during a typical day, she says, ""I usually have a fruit smoothie with almond milk for breakfast, an apple and 12 nuts for lunch, and then some steamed vegetables or a salad for dinner."" When asked about exercise or other physical activity besides basketball, she reports that she runs at least seven miles on a nearby trail every morning and spends two hours swimming laps at the indoor gymnasium pool every evening before bed. She says, ""The pool is pretty quiet at night. I don't like to be around a lot of people when I'm exercising.""    As you continue your dialogue, you ask the client open-ended questions to explore her relationship with her parents, especially her stepfather. She reports that her stepfather has always had negative remarks about her size and shape. She states that she feels like he views her as ""less-than"" because of her weight, which has led to feelings of shame and worthlessness. You explore the dynamic further by inquiring about how these comments have impacted her self-esteem. She reports feeling anxious, embarrassed, and inadequate when her stepfather is critical. You validate her feelings and explain that comments like these can be very damaging to a person's self-image.    You ask the client what she hopes to accomplish in therapy. After some thought, the client says that she wants to learn how to manage her anxiety. She looks at your shyly and says, ""I also want to be able to eat a piece of chocolate. I know that sounds crazy, but I just want to be able to enjoy it, without feeling guilty or like I'm going to get fat."" You affirm her desires and explain that a key part of the therapeutic process will be to help her build self-confidence and develop healthier relationships with food.  Sixth session You have been working with the client in intensive outpatient therapy and have been meeting with her two times per week. She is under medical care at the university's health center and has started taking an anti-anxiety medication that was prescribed by her physician. You have also referred her to a nutritionist for specialized guidance on developing a healthier relationship with food. You have established a strong, trusting relationship, and she has told you that she feels comfortable talking to you.    Today, the client brings up an issue that has been bothering her for a while: anxiety about eating around other people. She tells you that she usually gets her food ""to go"" from the cafeteria and eats at a bench outside or alone in her dorm room. She avoids eating in front of others when possible. However, at least once or twice a week, her teammates all go out to lunch after practice. This usually requires her to order food in front of them and she feels very anxious about it. She has been ordering the same salad with dressing ""on the side"" for several months because that is what makes her feel the most comfortable. One of her teammates commented on her ""same old salad"" and asked why she never got anything else to eat. Everyone at the table got quiet and turned to look at her. The client reports that the comment made her feel embarrassed and ashamed, like everyone was laughing at her. You ask her how she responded in the moment and she shares that she just laughed it off, but internally, she felt very embarrassed and anxious. You explore this further by asking her what emotions arise when she is around food, particularly in social settings. She reports feeling ashamed for wanting to eat ""fattening food"" because of her father's comments about her size. She skipped the last team lunch because she was so anxious about someone drawing attention to her food choices again. She closes her eyes and takes a breath. When she opens her eyes, you can see that she is struggling to hold back tears. She says, ""Everyone eats their food like it's no big deal. But it's a huge deal for me. It's all I can think about. I just want to be able to eat a meal without feeling guilty or like I'm going to get fat. I'm so tired of worrying about food all the time!""    You consider using exposure and response prevention techniques to address her fear and anxiety related to eating. You continue the session by identifying a list of foods and situations that trigger her anxiety and negative feelings about her body. You ask the client if she would like to meet with you for her next session right after practice and bring a lunch to eat in your office. She appears relieved and grateful to have a break from eating in front of her teammates.",Variable ratio intermittent reinforcement,"The client's parents divorced when she was six years old. Her mother remarried 12 years ago. The client has a younger half-brother who lives with her mother and stepfather. She is close to her mother, but ""my stepfather is a different story."" She reports that he is critical of her and often remarks on how she looks or what she is eating. She states that he has commented on her weight and body shape since middle school. Her mother tries to intervene, but her stepfather continues to be critical. She tells you she couldn't wait to graduate high school and move out of the house. She tells you, ""I remember that when I went home for a visit during winter break during my freshman year, my stepdad had this shocked look on his face when he saw me. He told me I had gained so much weight that I didn't even look like myself anymore. I've never forgotten that. And it's not like he's the picture of health."" Previous Counseling: The client has a history of anxiety. She saw a therapist for a few sessions in high school after being referred by her school counselor, but she did not feel comfortable with the therapist and refused to continue attending sessions. She did not receive a clinical diagnosis related to her anxiety. The client reports that she has been feeling more anxious lately and is struggling to cope with her anxiety. She says that she feels ""on edge,"" and that makes it difficult for her to concentrate. She is interested in exploring therapy to manage her anxiety.

(B): Fixed interval reinforcement
(C): Variable ratio intermittent reinforcement
(D): Fixed-ratio reinforcement",C,A," Explanation: To prevent the client from developing an unhealthy reliance on eating lunch in the therapist's office instead of in public, a variable interval reinforcement would be used. This type of reinforcement involves providing reinforcement at unpredictable intervals, which helps to maintain the client's motivation and encourages them to generalize their new behavior (eating in public) to other situations. This approach would help the client to develop a sense of confidence and independence in eating in public, rather than relying solely on the therapist's office as a safe space. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Explanation: Variable ratio intermittent reinforcement is the most effective schedule to reinforce a behavior. This kind of schedule results in high, steady rates of responding. Clients are persistent in responding because of the hope that the next response might be one needed to receive reinforcement.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

It would be the most suitable choice to depict the client's family dynamics, including cross-generational coalitions, subsystems, and other significant interactions. A genogram would help visualize the family structure, relationships, and patterns that influence the client's behavior and acculturation difficulties. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","SalvadorMinuchin, credited with developing structural family therapy, used family maps to graphically depict family dynamics, including cross-generational coalitions, subsystems, and differentiated intersectional boundaries. Family maps also show community supports and stressors, making it a good option for assessing protective factors and risk factors within the client’s community. A genogram is also a visual depiction of family dynamics and is commonly associated with multigenerational (extended) family systems therapy, also known as Bowenian therapy. Family maps differ from genograms in that family maps show family dynamics and identify social supports and connections. Genograms depict family interactions and generational relationships to reduce inappropriate boundaries (e.g., triangulation) by increasing diffusion. An eco-map is similar to a family map, but the emphasis is on intrafamily dynamics within their current social context. For this client, identifying social relationships and connections within the community can help determine protective factors (e.g., church, school) and identify risk factors (e.g., social isolation, peers) for the parents and the client. Eco-maps differ from genograms and family maps by viewing family boundaries as either open or closed to their social environment. Virginia Satir used sculpting as a human validation process model technique. Sculpting is a nonverbal exercise in which counselors instruct family members to physically position themselves to represent certain aspects and patterns of family relationships and interactions.","Logical Error, Knowedge Error"

This approach acknowledges the client's feelings while also encouraging him to reflect on his role in the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Focusing on helping him cope with his strong feelings would be most helpful to the client at this stage of the therapeutic relationship. Supporting the client in taking responsibility might make the client think that you are accusing him of being wrong about his interpretation of the situation.

The middle stage of group development, also appropriately known as the storming stage (Tuckman, 1984), is characterized by conflict among members, challenges toward group leaders, and the formation of alliances or subgroups. Group leaders are tasked with normalizing conflict and redirecting members to here-and-now interpersonal exchanges rather than labeling certain members as “problematic” or “scapegoats.” Core beliefs are schemas rooted in childhood. Although counselors can address core beliefs in process-oriented groups, caution must be used when group leaders interpret conflict as core beliefs, partly because it takes away from the group’s here-and-now focus. Exploring how members respond to difficult people in their lives is incorrect because it refers to other members as “difficult” rather than ascribing the conflict as member’s behaviors.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

Rick is a senior in high school and lives with his mother and two sisters. Rick does not want to participate in individual or group therapy, but his mother insists that he get help. During the intake, you work to establish rapport with Rick. You also gather information to determine if he is an appropriate candidate for one of the groups you are preparing to start, along with a co-facilitator. You suspect he may have trouble trusting females as he expresses anger when talking about his mother, sister, and ex-girlfriend. Since his father left, Rick says that his mother has been ""in his business"" all the time, and he does not feel like he has any real privacy.    You remain patient with Rick, listening to his story and validating his feelings. You empathize with him, letting him know it is understandable to feel frustrated about not having much privacy.

You explain to Rick that you are planning to start a group therapy session with a co-facilitator and that you would like to see if it would be a good fit for him. You explain that the group will provide an opportunity for him to talk about his experiences in a safe space with others who may have gone through similar situations In addition, you share that it could be an excellent way for him to practice expressing himself and developing trust in others.    You also explain to Rick that individual therapy sessions could be beneficial in addition to group therapy.

They have arranged for him to marry a daughter of a prestigious family in Korea after he completes medical school eight years from now, with the intention that he and his wife will live with them and provide financial support. However, this plan has drastically changed.    Seven months ago, the client's father moved out after his mother had an affair. The client became sullen, angry, and withdrawn after this event.

The couple appears more comfortable after this and even say a few statements to each other about shared experiences during the conversation. You circle back to the reason why they came to therapy, and the wife says that she assumes that she should talk first.

Practicing immediacy (A) can also be helpful, as it acknowledges the present moment and the husband's emotional experience. However, redirecting to the wife with questions about her response to his crying (C) may not be the most helpful technique in this moment, as it may shift the focus away from the husband's emotional experience and potentially create defensiveness. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).","Supporting the husband in using coping skills is the least helpful technique in this situation because the husband needs to feel safe expressing his raw emotions in the manner that comes most naturally to him. Otherwise, repression of these feelings may occur. Muting those feelings with trained coping skills detracts from an important element of processing because the husband and wife both need to experience their emotions surrounding their situation to better understand and express their viewpoints. Immediacy would be helpful because it involves directly addressing the presenting emotions and behavior. Allowing space for the husband to experience his emotions is helpful for the husband (as a releasing process) and also for the wife (to allow her to actively experience how her spouse is feeling). Redirecting to the wife may also be helpful because this may provide her with appropriate tools for responding to her husband’s emotions in a way that makes him feel supported and less isolated.",Logical Error

(D): Ask the client to choose two events in the next week and arrive at least 10 minutes late",B,C," Explanation: The client's need for control and perfectionism, especially regarding timeliness, stems from her upbringing and her relationship with her husband. To reduce her negative emotions related to being late, it would be most helpful to help the client identify ways that she can be proactive in being on time to events, which would give her a sense of control and accomplishment. This approach would also help her to develop more realistic expectations and reduce her feelings of frustration and anger. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",Prolonged exposure helps an individual to gradually become more comfortable with situations that cause high emotions or anxiety. The client's rigidity that causes her distress when she is late can be modified by helping her create a plan that gradually exposes her to not meeting her own time constraints and allows her to become more comfortable without her perfectionistic tendencies related to time. Asking the client to choose two events and arrive late without preparation may increase the client's embarrassment and self-anger because she has not yet experienced positive situations when she has been late.

To build a level of comfort with the client, the therapist could use the immediacy skill, which involves addressing the client's feelings about the session and the therapist in the present moment. This can help the client feel heard and understood, and can create a sense of safety and trust. For example, the therapist could say, ""I've noticed that you seem uncomfortable talking about certain things. Can you tell me how you're feeling about our session so far?"" This approach can help the client feel more at ease and build a stronger therapeutic relationship. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","Because talking has not been beneficial, playing a game may help develop comfort because play is a nonthreatening activity that does not require disclosure. Play also helps some children lower their guard, and they may begin talking or be more willing to talk while you play.

She says she feels that she has let her family down by having cancer because it costs them monetarily and emotionally; she wonders sometimes if her cancer is a punishment for something she’s done.

Asking ""What makes the client feel most upset today?"" (B) will help the counselor understand the client's current emotional struggles and prioritize the issues to be addressed in therapy. This question is more focused on the client's current emotional experience than the other options, which are more exploratory or historical in nature. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Regardless of counseling theory used, understanding the client's coping skills, including how they have changed over time provides the counselor with information on whether the client needs to be taught new coping skills or may already possess skills that can be used in therapy.

(B): The differences between ambivalence and anxiousness
(C): The research that shows Borderline Personality Disorder tends to decline with age
(D): The differences in manipulating others and making suicidal threats to prevent abandonment",B,D," Explanation: Based on the client's presentation, it appears that he is struggling with feelings of inadequacy, irritability, and a pattern of manipulative behavior in his relationships. He also has a history of substance abuse and has made suicidal threats in the past. Given these factors, it would be most helpful to educate the client on the differences between manipulating others and making suicidal threats to prevent abandonment. This education could help the client understand the impact of his behavior on others and himself, and potentially reduce the risk of suicidal behavior. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","The client presents with ambivalent affect for a second time as well as a BPD diagnosis. BPD is a personality disorder that centers around the anxiety of being rejected and abandoned, which this client appears to have experienced often. Because the client shows little insight into himself and his thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, helping him to distinguish between when he doesn't care and when he doesn't actually care and when he feels too anxious to attempt caring, will help him better understanding his feelings. Teaching the client about the causes and familial links of BPD may influence him to focus on others and how he has been harmed, rather than on his own current problems. The fact that BPD tends to decline with age may be hopeful news but may also encourage ambivalence as the client is already unmotivated to make changes in himself. Finally, the BPD client may make suicidal threats to prevent abandonment, but the threats are also indicators of the pain the individual is experiencing.

It is true that, when multiple clients are present such as in group, family, or couples counseling, you cannot guarantee confidentiality from all members, but you should encourage all clients to maintain confidentiality for the benefit of the group process. Although the clients may be forced to be in the group, you cannot force anyone to do anything against their will, which includes participation in mandatory therapy.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

ASD is typically diagnosed in early childhood, whereas schizophrenia typically develops in late adolescence or early adulthood. The other options, Intellectual disability (ID), Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Reactive attachment disorder, are all potential differential diagnoses for ASD, as they share some similar symptoms or may co-occur with ASD. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","Reactive attachment disorder is not a differential diagnosis for ASD. Reactive attachment disorder is often caused by insufficient care from a primary caregiver and is characterized by limited seeking of comfort or wants when distressed, limited positive affect, and unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness. ID, ADHD, and schizophrenia are all appropriate differential diagnoses for ASD. ID can also present as a delay in development; however, it differentiates itself in older children because social skills are not as impacted as they are with ASD. ADHD can be similar to ASD due to attention difficulties, but these difficulties are secondary to the child’s hyperactivity. Schizophrenia with childhood onset can present similarly to ASD because social skills can be impacted in the early phases of this condition.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

Adjustment Disorder-New Module 20 assesses adjustment disorder symptoms, which can be comorbid with MDD and PTSD.

The Acute Stress Disorder Scale assesses acute stress symptoms, which can be a precursor to PTSD.

This suggests that he may be hesitant to form connections with others due to fear of abandonment or rejection. By taking him aside during the session and processing his feelings, the therapist can create a safe and non-judgmental space for the client to express himself. This approach acknowledges the client's concerns and validates his emotions, which can help build trust and increase his willingness to engage in the group process. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Using dyads (breaking away into groups of two to discuss prompted topics) can be helpful in this scenario because they provide the client an opportunity to speak with a peer, a context that may be more comfortable to hesitant group members than speaking to the therapist, whom they are yet to trust.

She has a history of being a ""controller"" in her relationship and has high expectations for neatness and being on time. She is struggling to manage her emotions and is taking it out on her children. Teaching the client relaxation techniques would be an appropriate skill to focus on in this session, as it would help her manage her anger and anxiety. This would also help her develop better coping mechanisms and improve her relationships with her children. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","The client has demonstrated that she uses rigid boundaries to control others, yet struggles and becomes angry when others attempt to control her. Explaining the concept of boundaries and how these can provide protection from others' overcontrol, while learning to recognize when the client is trying to control others is a skill which will assist her in each of the relationships she has brought into the counseling sessions thus far. Conflict resolution is an important skill which will be shared under the concept of boundaries. Currently, the client avoids conflict while giving in to her friends and feeling angry. Teaching conflict resolutions skills will help resolve this problem but will not help her learn to deal with controlling and being controlled. Active listening and attending skills will help the client as she communicates more effectively with others, but will not help her address her anger at being controlled or when she controls others and they do not submit.

Finally, he told her that ""this has been going on long enough"" and that she needed to ""get her act together."" After this conversation, the client experienced a panic attack and stated that she was ""terrified"" that she was dying. Her husband arranged for their neighbor to watch the kids and drive her to the hospital.    You tell the client that she must stop thinking she will die or progress in therapy will be unlikely. You reassure her that the physical sensations she feels during a panic attack are not life-threatening, even though they may feel that way.

When asked, the client admits to drinking before the session and is unable to provide an accurate account of how much he has consumed. He reports going to the local bar down the street from his house to have ""one drink."" He is also unable to provide any information on the location of his emergency contact. This lack of insight and awareness of his current intoxication, combined with the inappropriate behaviors he is exhibiting, prompts you to assess for the next level of intervention that is needed.  Seventh session The client's attendance in weekly therapy sessions has been inconsistent. Today, he presents to his scheduled session, and he hands you a discharge summary from another recent hospitalization. The client states that he was on one of his ""highs,"" went to a bar, and ended up fighting with one of the other customers. He says he has no recollection of how the fight started, but the person he was fighting with told him that ""his life was useless and that he would be better off dead."" The client states that having a few drinks and driving around in his car while listening to music helps him calm down. You validate the client's attempts to identify coping skills.    The client's depression is further evidenced by his lack of motivation and interest in activities he once found enjoyable. He reports feeling overwhelming hopelessness and expresses a pervasive feeling of worthlessness. His low self-esteem is apparent in his statements and is further evidenced by his inability to recall accurately the events leading up to the altercation.    The client's risk for self-harm is elevated, given his recent suicidal ideation. He reports feeling his life has no value and that he would be better off dead. His current safety plan is inadequate to address his risk for self-harm and is further exacerbated by his use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. The client has little insight into his current mental state and cannot accurately identify the signs of his deteriorating mental health. He lacks insight into his coping skills and their potential consequences and is unable to recognize the need for more comprehensive safety planning",Assessment for at-risk behavior," The client had a history of alcohol abuse and had been warned multiple times by his employer to stop drinking while on the job. The client's boss tried to counsel him, but he refused to accept help or advice. Instead, he continued driving while under the influence, and his reckless behavior eventually led to an accident. As a result, the client was dismissed from his job and has struggled ever since.    The client has been unsuccessful in finding other employment due to his record of drinking on the job. He has been trying to seek help with his drinking but without any success. He believes that therapy may be his last hope for getting his job back, and he is desperate to change his life. The client tells you, ""I started drinking years ago. I've tried to quit, but I can't do it."" He further states, ""It used to be a couple of beers, but that doesn't do it for me anymore. So now, I drink almost half a bottle of whiskey a day. I usually start in the morning because if I don't, I feel terrible; my hands shake, I feel clammy, and I get an upset stomach.

Both MAST and AUDIT are widely used screening tools to assess alcohol use disorders. However, AUDIT is a more comprehensive tool that assesses not only the severity of alcohol use but also the risks associated with it, which is critical in this client's case.

She reports no history of trauma, suicidal thoughts, or harm towards others.","You are a non-Hispanic counselor in a private practice setting.  Your client is a 42 year old female who reports that she has been working for the same accounting firm for 10 years and was recently laid off due to a downturn in the economy. She tells you that prior to this firm, she worked in a company doing managerial accounting that she joined right after college. She says that she has liked the people that she has worked with but over the past several years she has enjoyed her work less and less. She reports that she is upset to have lost her job but, in some ways, she sees it as an opportunity to find something else she is more passionate about, but she has no idea where to start.

(C): Is there a way that you can send your parents money and still have time to make your choices?
(D): I wonder if it would help if we talked about some ways that you can work through this.",B,D," Explanation: The client is expressing anxiety about finding a new career path and is worried about not being able to support herself and her family. The counselor should explore this concern further to understand the client's motivations and values. The question ""I wonder if it would help if we talked about some ways that you can work through this"" is an open-ended question that encourages the client to reflect on her concerns and explore possible solutions. It also shows empathy and understanding from the counselor. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).","Asking the client if this is something that she wants to talk about with you is the most appropriate question. The counselor must demonstrate respect for the client and her culture. Cultural beliefs about discussing family matters with strangers vary. This client's original intent for counseling was to seek career help, not discuss family issues. It would be necessary for the counselor to allow the client to determine what topics will be discussed in sessions. Asking the client what scares her most makes the assumption that she wishes to discuss her family dilemma more deeply (as noted above) and that she feels scared. It is important for counselors to allow clients to identify their emotions rather than have the counselor assign emotions based on the counselor's own feelings. Asking the client if she can both send money and have time to choose a career demonstrates the counselor's countertransference and need to fix the client's problem, rather than allowing the client to choose her own solutions. Response d is less obtrusive but still does not take the client's culture into account nor allows the client to decide if this will be a topic of counseling. As well, the statement demonstrates the counselor's lack of awareness of her own need to fix the problem.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

The client is a 15-year-old multiracial female who presents to the first counseling session with her mother. The session begins with the client's mother monopolizing the conversation, and it is difficult for the client to get a word in edgewise. The client's mother continually brings up her husband as a source of her daughter's problems. The mother says, """"Our daughter is not doing well in school and has been talking back to her teacher. I think it comes from the relationship she's had with her father."" The client interrupts and says, ""It's not Dad's fault! You're the one who abuses me!""

She struggles with being an “empty nester” and is mourning the loss of the life she and her husband built together.",Facilitate the negotiation of agreed-upon treatment goals.,"   ily and Work History: The client worked briefly as an office manager but became a stay-at-home mom once she had kids. As a devout Catholic, she reports feeling heartbroken and ashamed that her husband is filing for divorce. The couple frequently entertained guests at their home, which abruptly stopped after their separation. Her oldest daughter is not speaking to her and is “taking her father’s side,” which has caused her great sadness and resentment. Her middle child, who lives locally, is married with children but does not allow the client to visit her grandchildren unsupervised. She believes her children’s father has spread lies about her alcohol use and feels he “drinks just as much” but appears to do so with impunity.

(C): Teach basic relaxation and mindfulness techniques to help improve insomnia.
(D): Facilitate the negotiation of agreed-upon treatment goals.",D,B," Explanation: This client has a history of not following through with group therapy and has a defensive demeanor when asked about her drinking. By summarizing the client's presenting problem, barriers to treatment, and associated risks of prolonged alcohol use, the counselor can help the client understand the severity of her situation and the importance of seeking help. This can increase her motivation to comply with treatment and take responsibility for her actions. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","The therapeutic alliance is associated with instilling hope, optimism, and motivation—all of which are related to improved treatment compliance. One way to establish a therapeutic alliance is to negotiate agreed-upon treatment goals for therapy. This client-counselor collaborative relationship is also strengthened by having confidence in the methods used to attain these identified goals. Due to the client’s previous dissatisfaction with Alcoholics Anonymous, providing the client with 12-step recovery information would not be beneficial at this time. The therapist’s communication skills, including summarization, can positively affect the therapeutic alliance; however, summarizing the client’s problems, barriers, and risks is problem-oriented rather than solution-oriented. Providing problem-focused feedback can prevent the client from joining with the therapist. Relaxation and mindfulness are evidence-based approaches for improving insomnia.

In-vivo exposure mandating Mary to slowly attempt social engagements until she becomes comfortable may be harmful since Mary has concerns about Covid-19. Behavioral activation is a tool used for clients with depression who have poor motivation to take charge of their behaviors but may become more inclined once they engage in their desired behaviors regardless of how they feel. Mary has expressed desire to do the things she used to; she is just inhibited from doing so. Group therapy might be a great asset for Mary in time, but there should be a foundation of cognitive restructuring and learned coping skills for Mary to thrive in a group setting.","Logical Error, Knowledge Error"

Your client, Jane, is 28 years old and presents with her spouse, John, a 24 year-old Hispanic male for “problems communicating.” The couple report that they have been married for one year after cohabitating for one year prior to marriage. Immediately after their marriage they began trying to become pregnant. They state they sought help from a specialist after several months and on learning that some degree of infertility existed, Jane began hormone therapy. Jane notes that it was soon after this time that the communication problems between them began. She tells you that it was at this point that she and John realized that they may not be able to have a biological child together. John acknowledges that Jane has tried many times over the last year to bring up this topic for discussion, but he chooses not to engage her.  He tells you that he tends to believe that “if I don’t think about it, it will probably go away.” Jane agrees with John and reports that over time, the couple have talked less and spend much less time together. John agrees and says that sometimes “I may not say more than five words to Jane in a day.”  Jane reports that they have not been intimate in over two months.

(C): Have client sign release of records then send letter to referring provider with client summary
(D): Make a copy of the client's full chart and give it to the client to take to the provider",C,B," Explanation: When referring a client to another provider, it is essential to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining client autonomy and confidentiality. Having the client contact the referral and sign a release of records when completing intake forms (Option B) is the most appropriate action. This approach empowers the client to take an active role in their care, ensures that they are aware of the referral, and allows them to control the release of their information.  Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Having the client sign a release of records while your office facilitates connection between the referring and referral provider. The referring provider then can send a letter introducing the client, the reason for referral, and contact information. This minimizes miscommunication between the client and referral provider and may facilitate getting John into the provider more quickly. Confidentiality rules require that a counselor never divulges any identifying information about a client, even for referral, without a client's signed consent, so calling without that form would be inappropriate. You can have the client make an appointment and sign a release at the referral source's office, however, without the consent, the process could be delayed. Additionally, having signed the consent, the client is more likely to follow through with scheduling an appointment, particularly if contacted by the referred provider. Counselors do not provide clients with a complete chart. Upon request, clients may review their charts with a counselor and may request copies of progress notes. However, therapy notes are not shared with the client or when records are requested.",Logical Error

She also mentions her close relationship with her stepdaughter-in-law. Exploring her views on her family situation, both past and present, can help the counselor understand her dynamics with her family members, her feelings about their concerns for her, and how these relationships may be impacting her current life. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","The priority to explore would be the client's living situation because it is likely to relate to her socioeconomic status. Culture includes a client's race, ethnicity, socioeconomic style, family structure, and any group membership that the client is or becomes a part of that influences her identity and personality formation.

Exploring the client's views on her family situation and widowhood may provide other information for understanding the client's cultural formation, but these are not priority given the reason the client has presented for counseling.

However, during the low periods, she withdraws from social contact, feels hopeless and helpless, and has trouble concentrating. She expresses a desire to be liked, but people see her as an ""emotional roller coaster"" and avoid her. She is very talkative throughout the session and changes the topic frequently.

Can you fix me?"" You discuss the scope of your practice and explore options for treatment with her. You explain that one of your responsibilities as a therapist is to provide a safe space where she can express her thoughts and feelings without fear of judgement or criticism. You explain that through understanding and integrating different aspects of herself, she has the potential to develop healthier relationships both in and outside of work. You emphasize the importance of building self-awareness and developing effective coping skills as part of her journey towards healing. Ultimately, you focus on empowering the client by providing support, guidance, and skills that will enable her to make positive changes in herself so she can function more effectively in life moving forward.    You discuss the importance of the client taking an active role in her treatment process and explore methods she can use to become more mindful of her thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

(B): Schizophrenia
(C): Schizoaffective
(D): Substance/Medication induced psychotic disorder",B,A," Explanation: Mark's symptoms, such as hearing the voice of God, having incoherent thoughts, and displaying irrational behaviors, are indicative of a psychotic episode. The fact that these symptoms started after his trip to Africa suggests a possible trigger or stressor. Given the acute onset of symptoms, Brief Psychotic Disorder (A) is the most likely diagnosis. This disorder is characterized by a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, often in response to a stressful event, and typically lasts less than a month. Schizophrenia (B) is a chronic condition that typically has a more gradual onset, and Schizoaffective (C) disorder involves a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, which is not evident in Mark's case. Substance/Medication induced psychotic disorder (D) is also unlikely, as there is no mention of substance use or medication that could be causing Mark's symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Mark meets the criteria for Schizophrenia looking at his symptomology (hallucinations, sleep disturbances, incoherent speaking and writing, catatonia) and duration of onset. Brief psychotic disorder is ruled out as it is beyond the one month required timeframe. Schizoaffective disorder is also ruled out as there are no depressive or manic episodes.

Firstly, she is directly affected by the client's premature ejaculation and may have valuable insights into the issue. Secondly, her involvement can help the client feel more comfortable and open about discussing his sexual concerns.

This collaborative approach can lead to a more holistic and effective treatment plan. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).","The client’s PCP would be the most beneficial contact for collaboration in a holistic approach because the concern includes the influence of a medical condition.

(B): Remind him to look at others' perspectives
(C): Use prolonged exposure techniques to help the client delegate tasks
(D): Warn the client that at some point you will behave in a way that upsets him",D,A," Explanation: When working with a client who has Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), it is essential to understand that they often struggle with rigidity, perfectionism, and a need for control. They may have difficulty with emotional regulation and empathy. A feelings wheel or list can help the client identify and explore his emotions, which is crucial in developing self-awareness and empathy. This approach can help the client understand how his behaviors impact others and foster a more collaborative and flexible approach to relationships. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Warning the client that you will eventually behave in a way that upsets him is one of the most important things a therapist can do with a client who has OCPD. The client's tolerance for lack of perfection in others will be triggered when at some point the counselor, like others in the client's life, will behave or say something that violates the client's rigid standards or expectations for perfection. Violating the client's expectation for perfection from the therapist is frequently the cause for OCPD clients to terminate counseling. Forewarning the client of this provides the opportunity to talk about how staying in the therapeutic relationship can help him learn to manage the conflict. Using a feeling wheel or list will not be helpful with the OCPD client because increasing his self-awareness and insight will be needed before he is able to begin working through emotions. Likewise, looking at and understanding others' perspectives may be attempted but the client will eventually need to challenge his own perspectives of his way being the only right one, rather than focusing on others. Prolonged exposure is an effective treatment for OCD, but is not effective in treating OCPD.","Knowledge Error, Logical Error"
