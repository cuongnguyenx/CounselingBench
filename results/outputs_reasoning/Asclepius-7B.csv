Last week you suggested he see a psychiatrist, and you begin today's session by discussing the results of his psychiatric referral. The client reports that he was prescribed antidepressant medication. He is not feeling much relief from his depressive symptoms now, but his psychiatrist told him that it could take a few months for the medication to reach maximum efficacy. Next, you discuss treatment options and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy combined with his medication regimen. He is willing to try the combined approach, and together you create a treatment plan with both short-term and long-term goals. He mentions his job being a source of frustration. You spend some time discussing the client's job and his feelings about it. He expresses his desire to retire, but he worries about the financial burden it may place on his wife. He says, ""My retirement benefits are not that great, and I lost a lot of money in the stock market last year. I just don't know how I can make this work. I'm not sure if retiring now is the right decision."" You discuss other possibilities for him to consider for retirement, such as part-time work or freelancing in a field he enjoys. You also brainstorm with him about ways for him to transition out of his current job in a way that reduces conflict with his co-workers, such as taking scheduled breaks and speaking with his supervisor about his workload. You provide support and suggest that he speak with his wife about their financial situation before making any decisions about his retirement. He agrees and states he will bring it up with her this upcoming week.
