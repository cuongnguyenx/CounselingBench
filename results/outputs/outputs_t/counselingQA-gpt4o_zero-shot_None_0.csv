You are a new counseling intern in a community agency conducting virtual individual counseling sessions using Telemedicine technology. You were referred a 29-year-old female client by your agency’s Psychiatrist who felt she needed to return to weekly psychotherapy as she had previously been doing two years ago. During your initial assessment session, you learn she has three young children under age 8, lives with her fiancé who is the father of the two youngest children, and that due to medical reasons she is on disability through Medicaid and is unable to work. She tells you she has been depressed and contemplating suicide because she cannot find relief from her anxious thoughts.

The C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) is the best evidence-supported tool to assess the client's needs most quickly and thoroughly. Once a client is cleared for continuing the session safely, especially while in a telehealth session, other areas like panic can then be addressed. If the client is rated high risk for suicidality, the content of the session might then shift towards making referrals either for in-person care or possibly inpatient psychiatric services. The HDRS (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), PDSS (Panic Disorder Severity Scale), and the BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory) are all helpful tools that can be utilized in the assessment phase or as part of an ongoing treatment plan goal to further identify and define areas of need; they are however not considered the best options for crises interventions or specifically ruling out suicidality as the C-SSRS measures and informs history and present indicators of ideations, plans, intent and actual suicidal attempts.","Family History:

While it is preferrable for a counselor to have knowledge of psychiatric medications and their effects, it is outside of the scope of practice and must be deferred to the appropriate professional. The approach in answer b) does not adequately validate the client's psychiatric or medical problem, which should be prioritized initially over cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches until a client has stabilized. Using these techniques will be optimally effective in conjunction with the correct medication and in later stages of treatment once the therapeutic relationship has been more established. It is most often the case that a client demonstrates the need for CBT to show improvement; but the approach in answer b) is also needlessly confrontational during an intake session, which may disrupt the trust-building and information gathering phase. In this case, the client has already been working with the agency's Psychiatrist, therefore it would be best practice to have her discuss with her doctor directly. Neglecting to address the client's reported issues with her psychiatric medications can also be deemed a liability and thus it is important to follow up with the client to ensure her needs are being addressed despite the counselor's opinion that the client has preoccupation with the psychiatric portion of her care.","Family History:

Lacking history of counseling with this client and without further clarification of her issues, MI (motivational interviewing) and DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) are too confrontational. Validation of feeling has been regarded as one of the best ways to illicit a positive response from your client and gain their engagement, and REBT (rational emotive behavioral therapy) is an excellent choice within Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interventions to begin to help the client address her beliefs that are affecting her emotions rather than focusing on other people or events that have occurred. REBT's key tenets involve acceptance of self and others while learning how to challenge cognitive distortions affecting moods and behaviors. Regarding answer a), the scenario does not identify codependency as an issue despite the potential a counselor may consider it exists. Answer a) further involves recommending treatment for character deficits that she has not yet self-identified with you in counseling, nor has she yet requested for any outside support. Support groups are also an unrealistic option to consider since she is evidently already struggling with one online session let alone a long-term, in-person commitment.

Since the client has not experienced a manic episode for a period of at least one week, she does not meet criteria for Bipolar I Disorder. Her panic symptoms, however, may be better explained by her existing diagnoses of either anxiety or post-traumatic stress.

While gender dysphoria can very well be a legitimate concern for a child his age, begin the treatment planning process focusing on presenting problems related to the diagnosis. Should Avery or his parents bring up gender confusion later in counseling, the issue can certainly be addressed and explored at that time. While the counselor may have a personal theory of its connection to Avery's behavioral problems, it is best practice to first rule out known existing conditions.

You set up an initial assessment session with Avery and his parents in person at the school’s conference room and learn that he refers to his biological mother as “dad” and her wife as “mom”, and that he has a twin brother with Autism. Mom tells you Avery sees a psychiatrist for medications but frequently has them changed because she feels they are not working. Mom reports Avery has trouble sleeping at night, hits and kicks her and his brother when he’s angry and steals food from the kitchen and hides it in his room. She must ask him multiple times to complete a task and he often will not comply or forget each time he is told.

This is especially a good choice for a client who has little insight into their problem (either from a maturity standpoint, age, cognitive ability, or to help with personality disorder) and needs help controlling their bodily reactions immediately without necessarily understanding the underlying reasons why they react the way they do. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches will also be useful for Avery but focus on identifying and changing negative beliefs and thought patterns that contribute to maladaptive behaviors, which is critical for long term change. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is the preferred intervention for autism, and holistic therapies can be considered to provide additional support but are not all clinically evidence-based and do not directly apply to the interventions listed in the question.","Family History:

Melanie has been in mental health counseling for several years through your agency and was referred to you by her last counselor who obtained a position with a local University and was leaving your company. Melanie is a 32-year-old Caucasian female who lives in a house with her boyfriend and her 9-year-old son, Gus, who suffers from ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD. Melanie is receiving psychiatric medication from your agency’s Psychiatrist, another Psychiatric practice by a Nurse Practitioner in a different city and is being treated medically by a Gastroenterologist who has also prescribed medications. Melanie is complaining of ongoing depression caused by her chronic nausea and a cyclic vomiting syndrome and does not want to leave her bed out of helplessness and hopelessness that nothing will ever change. She also reports experiencing anxiety and panic-like attacks when she is around others which causes her to socially isolate for sometimes days at a time. She is upset she cannot care for her son the way she desires and wants to continue counseling to help her feel better.","After the first session, what should be your next steps in counseling Melanie?",Conduct evidence-based substance use assessment screenings,Align with her empathically and refer her to a 12-Step program in her area,Conduct an intervention immediately and refer to an inpatient rehabilitation facility,Engage Melanie in discussing her use further using MI and evidence-based screening tools,Engage Melanie in discussing her use further using MI and evidence-based screening tools,"While it may seem pertinent to conduct an intervention and refer to a rehabilitation facility, only through a thorough and detailed inventory of the type, amount, frequency, and consequences of Melanie's substance use, followed by an understanding of her perception of her usage and level of readiness to change can you make an educated next step in response to her reported legal use of marijuana. Cannabis is considered by the FDA as a schedule I drug with no accepted medical purpose and a high potential for abuse. If you feel uncomfortable or untrained in performing official screening tools, using basic counseling interventions such as Motivational Interviewing (MI) to have Melanie provide more details would be sufficient prior to considering a referral to a detox or rehab facility or even to an interventionist. Based on Melanie's denial, it is unlikely she is in a stage of change willing to undergo treatment for marijuana use and it is presumptuous to consider it the primary cause of her problems without learning more.","Family History:
Melanie has what she states is a “complicated” relationship with her family, including her mother, whom she believes wants no involvement with her or her son, and has no contact with anyone else. Melanie states her falling out with her mother began when she was just a child. She comments that her father and her were “very close”, but his new wife makes it “challenging to communicate with him.” Melanie has lived on her own for much of her life and has not engaged in or sustained any relationship with her first three children.

There are advanced technologies available in some treatment centers that provide Neurofeedback services which have been proven effective in addressing treatment of trauma on a neurochemical level concurrent with talk therapy services, but this is not the same as EMDR and either way it is safest for a client to have learned coping skills prior to any experimental or evidence-based treatments.

The Rapid Alcohol Problems Screen was specifically noted in clinical trials to have increased sensitivity for and best performance results with the African American population.

John tells you he has two children, a 34-year-old son he had with a one-night stand in college and an 18-year-old daughter with his ex-wife the first year they were married.

Work History:
John has a master’s degree in Business Marketing and made his connections with his current position through contacts he made while playing on collegiate basketball teams. John has always worked busy jobs with which he becomes heavily engaged in and puts in overtime hours. John prefers work that keeps him on the road and traveling often, as he does not like to engage in the same routine every day. He mentions when he was younger, he could not keep a 9-5 office job or at any place that did not encourage individuality, saying he “butted heads” with all his managers and bosses until he was older.
 
Legal History:
John has had two arrests made for domestic disturbances in his home that his wife called in after heated arguments that left his wife afraid for her life. He was always able to make bail and was never tried or sentenced as charges were usually dropped thereafter.

Work History:
John has a master’s degree in Business Marketing and made his connections with his current position through contacts he made while playing on collegiate basketball teams. John has always worked busy jobs with which he becomes heavily engaged in and puts in overtime hours. John prefers work that keeps him on the road and traveling often, as he does not like to engage in the same routine every day. He mentions when he was younger, he could not keep a 9-5 office job or at any place that did not encourage individuality, saying he “butted heads” with all his managers and bosses until he was older.
 
Legal History:
John has had two arrests made for domestic disturbances in his home that his wife called in after heated arguments that left his wife afraid for her life. He was always able to make bail and was never tried or sentenced as charges were usually dropped thereafter. John admits to one drinking and driving accident when he was 19 where he served community service and fines as punishment.","(A): Foundational listening, attending, and reflecting skills

You are a mental health counselor with a community agency and have been referred a new client named Millie, an 18-year-old African American girl, for problems adjusting to life without her mother who has passed away nearly one year ago from illness. Millie’s father brought her to your agency after convincing her to see a counselor. The referral form filled out by her father says she has never spoken about her mother’s death and does not talk about it with anyone he knows. Millie has had medical problems that have been best explained by disruptions in her eating and sleeping habits, which started after her mother died.

The counselor should not pressure the client to speak on this issue when they are not ready, but to effectively address treatment it will be necessary.

Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, recurrent (F33), Anxiety disorder (F41.9) provisional
 

You are a mental health counselor with a community agency and have been referred a new client named Millie, an 18-year-old African American girl, for problems adjusting to life without her mother who has passed away nearly one year ago from illness. Millie’s father brought her to your agency after convincing her to see a counselor. The referral form filled out by her father says she has never spoken about her mother’s death and does not talk about it with anyone he knows. Millie has had medical problems that have been best explained by disruptions in her eating and sleeping habits, which started after her mother died. You learn several reports were made during her senior year in high school of her fighting with other girls, which Millie tells you were erroneous and “not her fault”. Millie also demonstrates a highly active social life, but primarily online with strangers as she exhibits strong social phobic behavior in public and around others in person. You recommend in-person counseling rather than Telehealth virtual sessions to support her improvement.","Millie agrees to enter your referred treatment program, a state-run facility that does not require her father's insurance as payment. Her father has left several voicemails for you, asking which program she is in and how to reach her. What is the most helpful response?","HIPAA prevents you from divulging this information, so you do not call back.",Call the father back to apologize and explain why you cannot tell him.,"You can tell him she is in detox within the state, but not the name of the facility.",Contact the treatment program and tell them to call Millie's father.,Contact the treatment program and tell them to call Millie's father.,"This is the most helpful option as Millie's counselor because, while HIPAA does not permit you to divulge the information to her father since she is 18 years old and did not sign the consent form you provided, you can help facilitate communication with the family by letting the facility know the family is trying to make contact.  It will be up to her new facility to then work with Millie on signing a release form and communicating with her father. Calling the father back only to tell him you cannot help him is still violating the boundaries of HIPAA since Millie did not sign consent for you to communicate with him. Simply ignoring the voicemails altogether without further action as in answer a is neglectful of the family's needs, even if you are unable to influence the outcome of their contact.","llie was well groomed and presented as anxious with constricted affect as evidenced by shaking her leg and tapping her pen frequently.

You are a counseling intern working in a private practice with your supervisor and several other interns. Taylor is a 29-year-old college student who was referred to you by her university’s resource center for mental health counseling. Taylor went to them requesting someone to talk to about her family stress. Taylor’s 18-year-old brother has autism and is preparing to go to college in another state, and Taylor is feeling anxious about the transition since he will be leaving home for the first time and their family will not be around to help him. Taylor has been manifesting her anxiety in ways that are causing her difficulty in school and in her relationship, such as trouble concentrating, completing assignments, and lashing out with aggressive reactions towards her parents or her boyfriend whenever they bring up the topic of her brother’s college. She has even yelled at her brother once out of frustration. Taylor is hoping to find ways to cope with her stress and manage her emotions over her family’s decisions.",Which of the following scales are not likely to be used in this scenario?,Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI),Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS),State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI),Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS),Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS),"The DASS measures the structure of negative emotional states and addresses both depression and anxiety. While a counselor may benefit from information provided in any instruments used, there was no noted depression in Taylor's case making this option the least helpful choice. On the NCMHCE, it is best to focus only on symptoms provided leading you to address the listed diagnosed condition. The BAI is a brief, self-report assessment for measuring anxiety and its severity level. The HARS helps detect the extensiveness of anxiety using clinical ratings to help better understand individuals with already diagnosed conditions. The STAI is used to measure trait and state anxiety differentiate for depression symptoms and has been used in research as an indicator of caregiver distress. Any of these would be useful at some point in Taylor's counseling process.","Family History:
Taylor lives at home with her parents and her brother, and commutes to University for her Bachelor studies. She stayed at home since graduating high school to help her parents with her brother with autism. Her parents had separated on and off for several years because of an affair her mother had, so the house has had tension and instability making Taylor feel responsible to keep her brother on a stable routine. Taylor comments that her brother’s challenges have always “taken up all her time” and that she used to complain about them, but now that he is going to be on his own, she is very upset she will not be able to be there for him. She complains her parents are “flaking out” on her and feels left out of their decision making but does not know what to do about it.","(A): Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)

Teaching communication skills would be the most helpful intervention to help Taylor independently handle her own relationship issues. Conducting family interventions is not appropriate when Taylor, who is an adult, is the only one in the family who has requested help. Offering a support group as a resource is always an option to provide your clients but does not have to be a goal within itself; listing attendance to a relevant support group can fall under an objective within the greater goal of communication skills or emotional management. Academic advisement can be addressed by her school and is not necessarily a treatment provided by a mental health counselor. The subject of improvement in concentration relevant to her academic performance may be presented throughout counseling, however.","Family History:

Neglecting to offer interventions that lead her to change but instead placating with sentiments of comfort is unhelpful and irresponsible. Thought stopping and refocusing strategies are useful for clients who suffer intrusive thoughts, traumatic memories, or struggle with ruminations and are not the best match for a client who desires to intentionally think more about her feelings with the goal of modifying her thought processes.

Taylor is hoping to find ways to cope with her stress and manage her emotions over her family’s decisions.","Given the level of information Taylor has shared in her e-mail, what is the appropriate response?",Do not respond and discuss virtual safety and protocols in the next session.,E-mail a detailed itinerary of your next session's goals and activities for both siblings.,Send new client documentation for her brother to sign prior to the next session.,Inform that e-mail is for scheduling purposes only and that it is unethical to see her brother.,Inform that e-mail is for scheduling purposes only and that it is unethical to see her brother.,"You must make mention of the inappropriate use of e-mail. E-mail communications regarding symptoms (or in Taylor's case her mention of crying spells and driving emotionally) increase the safety risk of your client and could end up causing a liability issue. Answer a is not best practice as it neglects to set boundaries, which could complicate the next session if she decides to have her brother present. Answer b only further encourages this type of communication for clinical discussion and unless you have worked out an arrangement where assignments will be delivered via e-mail, inclusive of a signed Telemedicine consent form outlining these details, it is not best practice. Answer c neglects to address any of these aforementioned factors and focuses solely on getting legal permission to see Taylor's brother next session. It is furthermore unethical to be her brother's counselor, especially since Taylor's presenting problems for counseling involved her complex feelings about her brother.","Family History:
Taylor lives at home with her parents and her brother, and commutes to University for her Bachelor studies. She stayed at home since graduating high school to help her parents with her brother with autism. Her parents had separated on and off for several years because of an affair her mother had, so the house has had tension and instability making Taylor feel responsible to keep her brother on a stable routine. Taylor comments that her brother’s challenges have always “taken up all her time” and that she used to complain about them, but now that he is going to be on his own, she is very upset she will not be able to be there for him.

Diagnosis: Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22)
 

You are a counseling intern working in a private practice with your supervisor and several other interns. Taylor is a 29-year-old college student who was referred to you by her university’s resource center for mental health counseling. Taylor went to them requesting someone to talk to about her family stress. Taylor’s 18-year-old brother has autism and is preparing to go to college in another state, and Taylor is feeling anxious about the transition since he will be leaving home for the first time and their family will not be around to help him. Taylor has been manifesting her anxiety in ways that are causing her difficulty in school and in her relationship, such as trouble concentrating, completing assignments, and lashing out with aggressive reactions towards her parents or her boyfriend whenever they bring up the topic of her brother’s college. She has even yelled at her brother once out of frustration.

Concurrent to teaching coping (self-soothing techniques included) you should engage your client in cognitive interventions, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy approach and trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral therapy. Once they have thoroughly discussed their traumas and become comfortable managing their reactions and emotions in counseling sessions, they should continue interventions such as neurofeedback operations or EMDR (eye-movement desensitization reprocessing) techniques. Neurofeedback machines are not commonly found on most agency sites and technicians must be specialty trained to administer the resource; but they have been found to drastically reduce emotional complications from trauma, anxiety, and depression often in a single session. EMDR is a specialty intervention requiring licensure and/or certification and training. As a counseling intern in a state-run facility, you would have to order a referral for this service. EMDR interventions may seem like the first line of defense in treating trauma, however without first feeling comfortable with approaching traumatic content in therapy and having confidence in one's ability to self-soothe resultant anxiety, it is possible for EMDR to be too challenging. Prolonged exposure therapy is effective if relatable to certain traumas where one can control the reduction of fear response associated with the trauma (i.e., driving over the bridge where they had a car accident, or taking a shower after being attacked in water). It would not be appropriate for Shania who has a history of physical and verbal abuse by her parents.","Substance Use History:

This attitude would be supportive of Bob's mental state as he seems to be rejecting clinical evidence of his need for recovery. Answer a) would likely trigger Bob since he was just relieved of his occupation and these groups focus around how to balance substance use recovery and an active professional career. A group where Bob would be the oldest adult as in answer b) might also not be helpful based on his presentation and attitude of disinterest in rehabilitation, which could be negatively influential on the others in the group.

The AUDIT is a 10-item screening tool created by the World Health Organization to assess for alcoholism. It is both clinician-administered and has a self-report component.

Bob has already admitted to drinking his entire life and is aware of his reason for admission into rehabilitation, however, presents as in denial over the severity of his use. The SADQ-C is specifically tailored to measure the severity of dependence once alcohol dependence has already been identified.

This strategy employs a person-centered perspective that attempts to move an individual away from a specific negative behavior or maladaptive decision and towards using their own motivations to make positive changes. Using nonjudgmental, empathic questioning, you are more likely to uncover Bob's underlying motivations and help him develop a better safety plan. Validating Bob's feelings empathically as with answer a) is always appropriate; however, Bob is hyper-focused on making an unhealthy choice and is not currently sharing his feelings. Furthermore, validating Bob's stated choices can be confusing and render ineffective any attempts at getting him to stay in treatment. Reality therapy is also a client-centered form of CBT that focuses on improving present relationships and circumstances, but its intention is to avoid discussion of past events which is not ideal in the situation of trying to help Bob build insight into how past events have led him to where he is now. While its key concepts focus on choice, responsibility, and commitment to change, it is an exploration of processing what behaviors a client is displaying and whether it is interfering with them meeting their needs. It is an excellent choice of strategies for longer-term therapeutic techniques once Bob has decided to commit to the counseling program but will meet too many challenges if Bob is resistant and unwilling to engage. Confrontation is the preferred method by operational staff in many treatment facilities as it is usually conducted with appropriate clinical intentions by peers who can help a client in distress feel supported; but it is not an evidence-based method that a mental health counselor would choose in an individual session and especially not with a senior adult presenting as defensive. Confronting a client in this situation when they are within their legal right to leave a voluntary treatment program may result in the client making an even riskier departure which might further cause harm.","Work History:

William is casually dressed and with good hygiene. William’s rate and tone of speech are normal with motor movements appearing tense and agitated as evidenced by shifting of position and frequent crossing of arms. William avoids eye contact the entire visit. William denies any depression however his chart indicates that he reported having a history of depression with suicidal thoughts. He says, “Only God can judge me, and I know where I’m goin’ so I don’t have any worries about whether I go now or later.” You then notice in his intake he identified as Christian with active faith-based beliefs.

You are a mental health counseling intern providing brief crisis intervention and counseling support for patients admitted to a substance use rehabilitation facility at the detox-level of care. Your clinical director schedules William to meet with you on his first Monday morning after being admitted the Friday night before for alcohol dependency. William tells you he had a “medical issue” last week that “freaked his wife out” and she said she would “kick him out of the house” if he did not come to your program. He notes that he has been drinking their entire marriage and does not understand why it is suddenly such an issue for her, but that he would have “nowhere to go” otherwise so he conceded to coming in. You learn from the overnight staff nurse that William had several bouts of delirium and vomiting with tremors over the weekend, and one instance of a seizure which required emergency interventions to have him stabilized. You ask what “medical issue” he was referring to and she tells you that his chart indicates he had a heart attack. William interjects, saying “She thought I had a stroke, but it wasn’t that big a deal I just had some bad indigestion.” He is now on a benzodiazepine regimen to help regulate his symptoms and stabilize his mood throughout his detox process until he can report a reduction in anxiety and be seen by the weekday psychiatrist.","While Bob shared the reason that he believes he started drinking, he does not demonstrate insight into other reasons he continued drinking or why his dependency increased. This may be due to a lack of knowledge in what topic of information?",anxiety,complex trauma,ASAM definition of addiction,drug interactions,ASAM definition of addiction,"The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences. It also defines addiction as a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry. If Bob understood that addiction does not have a single cause or trigger but is a combination of contributing biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors, he may be more willing to consider treatment recommendations. Understanding the implications that anxiety or trauma has on his drinking would still only point to Bob blaming specific triggers or feelings, and not fully contemplating the role his own biology, choices, and other life experiences have had on his alcohol problem. Drug interactions are not applicable in Bob's case but may play some role if certain medications or other medical conditions were present.","Work History:

If Maria insisted on privately counseling, or if there were no familial options available, it may be possible for Maria to sign her own consent forms provided she is able to demonstrate understanding of her confidentiality rights. You must first check with your state's laws concerning minors seeking therapy without parental consent, as some states allow for a counselor to provide a limited number of sessions or for specific circumstances for children as young as 12 years old. Another option would be for Maria's school counselor to provide Maria counseling within the school, but school officials would not be able to take the place of Maria's guardians on your agency's consent paperwork.

In the first few hours or days following a significant trauma, a client may not be ready to address their grief and loss, as they are still in shock and likely unable to process the event as well as they could weeks later through cognitive therapy. A teenager is unlikely to be motivated for counseling if they feel they will be forced to discuss a pre-written agenda, and in Maria's case it is clear she is unwilling to share her own thoughts or feelings about what happened. Using clinical language is also challenging for a teenager to connect when using simpler language would be more helpful. Telling them they can talk about whatever they want is mostly true, however you want to inform her that the purpose of the sessions is to help her through this trauma - and neglecting to share that may also come off as insensitive. Furthermore, telling a minor you will not share anything they tell you is misleading as you are required by law to break confidentiality if she reports being abused, plans to hurt herself, or is going to harm someone else.","Family History:

You are a mental health counseling intern providing sessions for students inside of a high school. Maria enters the conference room that you use to meet with students and sits down to tell you that she needs help for her siblings. You have no referral for Maria and were not scheduled to meet with anyone during this hour of the day. Maria shares that two days ago, her and her two younger elementary school siblings witnessed their father take a gun to their mother, shoot and kill her, and then use the gun on himself. She tells you she is fine and does not need counseling, but she wants her brother, age 7, and sister, age 4, to receive counseling because it was likely “very traumatic for them.” Identifying that Maria is clearly in shock, you offer your sincere condolences, followed by recommending Maria have counseling as well. She declines at first, insisting she is doing okay and has nothing to talk about. After inviting the school counselor and assistant principal to the discussion, with Maria’s permission, they help convince her that it would be healthy for her and her siblings if she was also being seen by a counselor. The principal adds that some of the school staff, including herself, responded to the incident the following day by going to the neighbor’s house to assess for the children’s safety and let them know they had permission to take a leave of absence from school. Maria insisted on coming to school the next day, saying she was “fine” and “needed the distraction.” Maria consents to meeting with you, but only because she believes it will help her family stick together.

It is an empathic technique, much like the active listening skill of reflection, only because it is non-verbal it draws a different reaction. Telling Maria, ""I noticed as you discuss your brother's fears, your leg begins to shake,"" is an open invitation for Maria to share if or why she thinks they are connected phenomena. This can lead to a CBT discussion about how thoughts and feelings affect our behaviors. Anxious behaviors, such as leg shaking, do tend to increase anxiety; however, your goal is not to get her to stop shaking. She may need this subconscious, compulsory action to release tension as she speaks. Regarding answers b) and d), you would not use these observations to prove the point that Maria needs counseling, or to make your counseling experience less distracting.","Family History:

She tells you after the incident occurred her neighbors rushed to their aid and were able to take them in until they can establish a more permanent living situation with their grandmother, who lives across town and is preparing to have them move in soon.

Address this with Mary right away as it demonstrates compassion and concern, helps you better understand her feelings and fears, and focuses in on another stressor that could be driving maladaptive behavior. Mary presents as in denial over her shopping patterns which may be driven more by perfectionism, compulsion out of boredom, and lack of life satisfaction more so than addiction. This would require further processing, but Mary does not have insight into this considering her response to your question during session. Changing the topic entirely to a different treatment plan goal or projecting her fears about her dog onto other known issues such as grief are both not the most compassionate and empathic choices.","

This can help inform the diagnostic process during intake as well as be applied later in counseling. The ANSA is a comprehensive tool used for clients and treatment teams to score progress and goals and helps determine appropriate level of care and quality improvement; it is primarily only used as insurance requirements dictate and can be useful in the intake process but will not provide any details regarding Leah's behaviors as it is there for you to mark down your perspectives of her functioning based on information you already have. The YSQ is related to long-term personality deficits and is conducted when applying schema therapy interventions; this can be useful as a treatment intervention but will not target a better understanding of how Leah behaves impulsively and her reasons. There is no evidence to suggest Leah struggles with ADHD, as impulsivity can be present in adults without ADHD.","

This is a gentle and non-invasive intervention for helping Leah improve her session's quality. As her counselor, you are trying to get to know her and help her feel heard and understood at the same time; silently listening to her vent without being able to reflect, summarize, or ask questions to get to know her better is not necessarily more helpful for Leah. You are also responsible for completing this intake within a specific amount of time while honoring her VA benefit authorizations; while this does not take precedence over Leah's need for therapeutic engagement, it is an administrative aspect of professional counseling that is necessary for order and maintenance of boundaries. Answer a) projects a critical demeanor and may cause Leah to feel offended or stifled in her sharing, and answer d) is unnecessary as you are having her stop and repeat herself. Answer b) is not realistic if she has not taken a breath for 30 minutes and your intake is only scheduled to be 55 minutes.","

Therefore, using the same strategies as you would with a client who does not already possess prior knowledge of anxiety reduction skills will offer the most effective delivery of emotional comfort. Normalizing or validating her distressing thoughts has been proven in behavioral therapy techniques to actively reduce a person's momentary suffering because it allows them to feel the way they do without challenging them to fight against it which can often be more anxiety-provoking. Using strengths-based and positive psychology strategies of reflecting her virtues as a mother who prioritizes her child is a way of motivating her out of her own value system and hopefully leading her into a discussion about accepting her temporary, unchangeable position. Reminding her of coping skills, offering her solutions, or even attempting to have her rationalize, are all secondary supportive techniques to helping Leah feel heard, understood, valued, and accepted. If she were momentarily able to use her coping skills, she would have. Reviewing them and challenging her at this moment could increase her feelings of shame she has already expressed that she is not able to put into practice things she knows she should do. Trying to solve her problems for her will not help her as much as regulating her disposition in session for her to be able to find solutions to her own problems.","

Common behaviors of children with ADHD involve inattention and impulsivity. While falling asleep in class in and of itself is not a criterion for ADHD, it is possible Raul feels overwhelmed or disengaged in class, therefore due to his inattentive type processing he may become sleepy when bored. It is also possible over-stimulation at other times of the day or night may make it difficult for him to get needed rest when it is more appropriate. If given too much information to process at once, a client with ADHD might lose focus and be incapable of remembering what was just said to them causing them to ask you to repeat it. Using single step directions and relatively short comments in conversations with clients whose ADHD is untreated can be helpful for them to process more easily what you are saying.","Education History:

This can be accomplished by practicing several skills after helping Raul prioritize his ""wants"" over his ""needs"" and working to achieve a ""greater goal"" later, rather than meeting lesser needs immediately. Working with Raul on what motivates him as well as helping him identify how he feels after he has indulged in an impulsive or compulsive action are ways to begin this process. Mindfulness would be challenging for Raul with inattentive type ADHD as he is unable to remain on task without constant guidance or direction. Aversion therapy contains tactics to help clients train their brains to avoid stressful stimuli (i.e., snapping a rubber band on their wrist whenever they recognize they are having negative thoughts, with the intention that eventually they can redirect their thoughts without a snap to avoid the pain of the rubber band). Thought stopping technique has similar intentions in that it can help with intrusive negative thoughts or worry that often accompany phenomena like anxiety or panic attacks.","Education History:

This is vitally helpful in treatment planning and providing interventions to help Raul learn to accept his reality, adapt to his circumstances, and cope with his distress, to prepare him for a successful future in an unpredictable world. One can control several factors in video gaming, giving a false sense of security and predictability as one navigates the rules of the game. When met with unprecedented challenges or failure, the consequences are minimal and thus capable of being managed with little effort. Gamers may experience and feel losses or frustrations in games passionately, resulting in large expressions of emotions and often impulsive behavior such as throwing their controller across a room; these are expressions of much deeper emotional conditions that have found a rather controllable outlet. While overstimulation may negatively affect an individual with ADHD, some games have been proven to support certain cognitive functions that can help with certain ADHD conditions when well-managed with boundaries and a balance of other activities. The ability to hyper-focus on gaming does not rule out ADHD; some people think if a child can focus on something like their video games, they could not possibly have ADHD. However, the deficits in the disorder relate to how well a child can pay attention to low interest activities or content. Children with ADHD can develop an obsession with high-interest activities due to their cognitive processing inflexibility. There is no evidence to support answer c) would be effective, although use of this idea in interventions would not be harmful.","Education History:

You are a brand-new counseling intern in the counseling resource center of a local university. Jonathan is a junior in college and comes to speak with you, as you are his newly assigned college university counselor. Jonathan is concerned about finals that he feels unprepared for, stating he is “overwhelmed” and “under too much pressure” from his family to “allow himself” to fail. He is making disparaging, negative remarks about himself and his abilities, often repeating himself and talking in circles using emotional reasoning. He asks you for help in getting his teachers to modify his deadlines so that he can have enough time to accomplish all his assignments, mentioning that his last counselor did that and called it “playing the mental health card”. There are no previous records on file for this student, but when you ask him who he met with he just changes the subject and continues to express his worry that he will “never amount to anything or graduate” if he fails these exams.","You run into one of Jonny's teachers in the breakroom shortly after session and he says to you, ""I hear you are meeting with Jonny, that's good. He really needs it."" He sits down with you and asks, ""Did he ask you to extend his deadlines? He's done that with all the counselors."" How do you respond?","""Yes! He told me he has not done that before. I'll have a talk with him.""","""No, he has not said anything like that. Why do you think he really needs counseling?""","""I cannot comment on things said in session, it is a violation of his trust.""","""I remember being stressed in college.

As a fellow staff member of the university, you are a team of professionals working together to help the students and may often need input from teachers to support your counseling efforts. Declining to comment out of confidentiality while a co-worker is showing interest and engagement in a fellow student can be viewed defensively, and you may lose your ally in providing Jonny well-rounded care. Lying about what Jonny has said or not said is also unhelpful. Asking a teacher for their input or observations of Jonny may be useful to your needs, but in this case, attempting to obtain input when you did not directly ask for it, is somewhat opportunistic. Also, a public break room during may not be the best time or place to discuss student therapy issues. Breaking Jonny's confidentiality as in answer a) is also unethical towards your therapeutic relationship with him.","Education and Work History:

The consequence of not working on assignments could be a lack of growth, which is why in speaking to Lottie's mom, who may be resistant to the idea of medication, the idea of submitting a referral for her evaluation should be prioritized.

Completing a genogram will provide insight into why the client responds to stressors in certain ways, but will not provide him with a tool to deal with stressors. Grounding techniques are helpful during times of anxiety but this will be a new skill that the client will need to learn, practice, and become habitual in using, whereas it will be easier to rely on a known skill that has proven to work.

His circumstances are not optimal; thus, he believes he cannot be successful, which impacts his emotional health and well-being. A suicide contract may be helpful but would have been completed in the intake if used, as the client states he has no suicidal ideation at this time. His increase in alcohol is an important clue to his lack of coping skills and should be addressed in session, but not for the purpose of diagnosis and referral at this time since it is a recent development.

Clients who are mandated to counseling often feel coerced into counseling and tend to be extrinsically motivated in order to achieve their desired outcome, in this client's case, to move back into her parents' home. Externally motivated clients may manipulate by not telling the whole story or playing the victim to increase sympathy from others. Important characteristics of counselors include empathy and positive regard. When working with a client who is manipulative, triggers counselor countertransference or over-sympathizing that impacts the session, or the counselor begins to make character judgements about people in the client's life who the counselor has not met, the counselor has lost the ability to be objective and cannot appropriately counsel the client. As the client has a history of thinking about harming others, poor insight, poor judgement, it will be necessary for the counselor to accurately assess mood, affect, and thoughts of harm during each session.","Family History:

MI helps the client determine what changes can help them get what they want and what steps they could take to make those changes. It is an effective approach for substance addiction, particularly when clients do not recognize their substance issues. It is less insight oriented and focuses on resolving ambivalence and resistance. The client's past and current choices, as well as the mental status exam demonstrate poor judgement and decision-making. She uses multiple substances with negative consequences but denies any substance use problems. The other three choices are insight approaches, which are non-directive and focus more on helping the client determine the root of their problems. These approaches will not be as effective for clients who lack insight or are externally motivated to attend counseling.","Family History:

She reports that using substances are the “only way to get to know people” and has found herself angry when attending parties where others were having fun but she was not drinking or high.","Based on the information gained from these three sessions, which intervention would be most effective in helping the client build insight related to her alcohol and substance use?",Complete a family genogram with information on substance use,Administer the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST),Have client attend a substance abuse therapy group,Gently challenge the client using her past history of substance use and outcomes,Have client attend a substance abuse therapy group,"Clients with substance addiction are prone to denying the extent that their substance abuse causes themselves or others. Family genograms and MAST assessments may provide information about patterns of use, but are not likely to facilitate insight when a client is in denial. Challenging the client with their history brings attention to incongruities, but the addict's need for deniability is strong with addiction and the counselor, particularly when working with a BPD client, must be aware of not rupturing the therapeutic relationship. Conversely, substance abuse therapy groups focus specifically on participants' addiction and the group model permits greater opportunities for participants to challenge members who minimize the effects of their addiction. A substance abuse treatment group allows the client to begin working on addiction outside of individual therapy and preserving that counselor-client relationship.","Family History:

Clinicians use different methods to identify these, however, identifying and modifying unhelpful core beliefs is the most important part of the process. Both the Stages of Change model and motivational interviewing are used when a client is resistant to making changes or when the counselor is unsure whether the client is interested in making changes. As the client has presented with a stated desire to address his alcohol use, the counselor can move directly into helping him work in this area. Abstinence contracts have shown positive and negative outcomes depending on the client and their values and willingness to embrace abstinence. Substance abuse treatment counselors vary in supporting an abstinence model or a harmful reduction model of treatment. Implementing an abstinence contract may not coincide with the client's values and desires.","Family History:

Working through childhood trauma allows the individual to see how the parental figures' behavior influenced the client's insecurity. The counselor often acts as a model parental figure during this time to help the client form secure attachments. Individuals with ambivalent attachment are anxious and insecure so building supportive relationships that offer security and trust is helpful for building self-esteem and secure attachments. Finally, children with attachment issues may have poorly developed social skills as they did not feel safe forming attachments early on. In this case, helping the client learn to respond to social cues and read body language may assist him in choosing healthy individuals with whom to form relationships.","Family History:

The couple do not provide evidence of a traumatic event suitable for a diagnosis of PTSD. Jane presents some symptoms of a MDD, though she does not meet full criteria at this time, though the counselor would continue to monitor her. John presents some symptoms of anxiety but does not qualify for a diagnosis of GAD. Adjustment disorders may include specifiers of anxiety and depressed mood, which encompass the symptoms that the individuals as a couple are currently exhibiting. A counselor would monitor each individual closely in case the Adjustment Disorder develops into a more severe diagnosis (Criterion C - the stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disorder).","Family History:

John appears to be disengaged from Jane and the marriage, so clarifying his goals for counseling is the most important task during this session. If John is not invested in counseling, movement toward resolution cannot be made. Jane's goals for counseling are also important, however, because she is the identified client, the one who both initiated counseling and the one who is seeking reconciliation with John, we can infer that her goal is to repair the relationship. Based on the information, Jane is engaged with her emotions and her affect is congruent with the sadness she feels at John's statement. John appears sad, which suggests that his affect is also congruent and that he is empathetic towards Jane.","Family History:

The most appropriate action is to refer him to psychiatry to have him evaluated and determine whether antidepressants are warranted. Only medical providers are allowed to dispense antidepressants. John took an SSRI previously with good results and his mood has decreased since stopping them 6-8 months ago. A psychiatrist will use this information to determine John's treatment for depression. You could refer him to his family physician but his doctor's previous linkage of his affective state with his blood pressure may influence how his doctor approaches the issue. Psychiatry specialists are experts in initial diagnosing and prescribing medication for depression. Once an effective level is achieved, John should follow up with his family doctor. Scheduling John for testing is unnecessary as you are observing depressive symptoms, John is affirming he feels depressed, and moving into treatment is the next step. Having John attend a support group may be helpful for him once his depression is controlled. This will provide a safe place for him to practice communication skills and vulnerability in sharing his thoughts and feelings.","Family History:

This minimizes miscommunication between the client and referral provider and may facilitate getting John into the provider more quickly. Confidentiality rules require that a counselor never divulges any identifying information about a client, even for referral, without a client's signed consent, so calling without that form would be inappropriate. You can have the client make an appointment and sign a release at the referral source's office, however, without the consent, the process could be delayed. Additionally, having signed the consent, the client is more likely to follow through with scheduling an appointment, particularly if contacted by the referred provider.

Attunement requires the counselor to emotionally engage with the client and their story and is the foundation of the therapeutic relationship. Acknowledging diversity and intersectionality and assuming a non-judgmental stance are both important parts of developing a therapeutic working relationship that allows the client to feel safe and understood during counseling. These are appropriate tasks but may be received as insincere if empathic attunement is not already present. Redirection to decrease negative thoughts may be helpful when using cognitive behavioral theory but should not be used when building the therapeutic relationship as the client may feel censured while telling their story.","Family History:

Support groups for cancer patients are specifically focused on the needs that these individuals face with their disease. It may be an effective concurrent therapy for this client at a later date, but the client's current expectation is individual therapy as evidenced by coming to counseling.

Having the counselor provide, or the client and her partner develop, a list for practice topics is likely to include more superficial topics since these are seen as practice opportunities. No evidence has been shown that the client struggles to ask for help except with her cancer journey and its impact on the couple's intimacy. Having the counselor roleplay with the client's partner puts the partner in the position to have to ""pull out"" what the client is really asking for, rather than helping the client communicate her needs more openly.","Family History:

She has had no thoughts of harming herself since then and has no thoughts of harming others.","You are a counselor in a community agency. Your client presents with concerns about her lifelong history of being “anxious and emotional” since her parent’s divorce when she was 12. She tells you her feelings of “anxiety and feeling badly about myself” intensified when she was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago and then again when her family moved to the area last year. She tells you that she thinks she managed her emotions well during her treatment because her focus was on getting through the crisis. She also was taking Klonopin twice a day for anxiety.  She says she feels that she has let her family down by having cancer because it costs them monetarily and emotionally; she wonders sometimes if her cancer is a punishment for something she’s done. She reports that she does not discuss these concerns and emotional fears with her partner because “she has become the breadwinner and I feel like I need to protect her from my negativity.” On intake forms, she endorses crying daily, trouble sleeping, concentrating on things, has been losing weight without trying, and constantly worrying about her health and the family’s finances. She tells you that her partner says she “runs around like a chicken with my head cut off because I start stuff like cleaning or cooking and then stop right in the middle of it. I just get restless and sometimes I just can’t stop fidgeting when I should be paying attention.” She notes that she is in menopause due to her cancer treatments, which included a removal of her ovaries three years ago and a hysterectomy one year ago. She tells you people often refer to her as a “cancer survivor” but she doesn’t feel like she has survived it because every surgery makes her feel like she “is losing another piece of me.” Additionally, she says that having to have body scans every six months and not being able to look in the mirror and see a “complete woman” makes her feel that she is still trying to survive, rather than putting it in the past.","Using the information you have learned, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",Teach the client that this is common post-cancer and most people get better with time,Teach the client relaxation skills to be used when she puts on a bathing suit,Help the client begin imagining herself undressed in front of a mirror,Help the client develop goals that can be accomplished related to her body image,Help the client develop goals that can be accomplished related to her body image,"Before beginning therapy on this area of the client's concerns, outcome goals should be developed in collaboration with the client. This helps the client identify her ideal image as well as her realistic image so the counselor and client can focus on the changes she would like to make in her body, thoughts, and emotions. Setting goals builds hope and lets clients know they are not alone. Research does show that body image concerns are normal post cancer and they do tend to get better with time. While normalizing her concerns may be helpful, it is not likely to lower the level of distress she is currently feeling. Systematic desensitization (SE) is a helpful practice in post-cancer body image counseling; however, SE is approached slowly so beginning with having the client imagine herself undressed or putting on a bathing suit at this time is likely moving too quickly. Clients often stop therapy when SE is rushed, as it increases their level of anxiety.","Family History:

This process allows her to develop more positive core beliefs and view herself in a more healthy and loving way. The diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) does not apply to this client as her post-cancer scars and body changes would not be viewed as minor imperfections to others. Additionally, she does not engage in repetitive behaviors such as mirror checking, skin picking, or mental acts in response to her concerns. BDD is a disorder related to obsessive compulsive disorders and this is not evident in the client's behaviors. Cancer impacts people across all cultural spectrums and the client's sexuality is not likely to impact how a cancer support group could benefit her. The client's prognosis in the area of body image and self-esteem is quite good because she has been successful already in counseling and while cancer is a medical condition, the diagnosis leads to many emotional issues such as anger, sadness, worry, and loss.","Family History:

He has already demonstrated little insight into his personal and professional problems. If he does not recognize the potential for impairment with his increased substance abuse, you may wish to report him to his licensing board - either telling him in advance or reporting anonymously. It is likely that your client will suspect you as the reporting source, which is likely rupture the therapeutic relationship. Sometimes it is helpful to talk with a client before reporting them as an impaired provider so that the report can be made collaboratively and the therapeutic relationship can be maintained. This allows the counselor and client to continue working on these issues, however, it is dependent on the client recognizing and having insight into their issue as a real or potential impairment. It is always appropriate to discuss impairment with other health professionals to determine if one's behaviors, thoughts, or emotions are actually or potentially impairing their work with clients.","Family History:

The client does not demonstrate excessive or irrational worry about the future as seen in GAD, and does not present with a history of trauma as needed for a PTSD diagnosis.

He tells you his concentration issues have always been present but have become progressively worse over the past eighteen months, as have his feelings of irritability, failure, fatigue, and lately he has pains in his chest and shoulder. He tells you that he thinks sometimes about what would happen if he died, but only as far as wondering how others would react. Later in the session, he says he is not suicidal and does not have a plan, but occasionally he just “gets tired of it all.” He tells you that sometimes he feels like “ending it” and has said that to women when the relationship isn’t going well and once or twice during breakups. He asserts that he has not actually tried to kill himself. He summarizes his relationships with others as “if they like me, they lose interest” and says that he finds himself “almost being manipulative” in how he chooses his words in his relationships with women and sometimes takes them on spontaneous “wildly expensive vacations” so they will not lose interest in him. The client tells you he has been in several relationships with women over the years, beginning with his high school sweetheart, then with his college sweetheart, but none of them have “worked out.” He states he was engaged to his college sweetheart at 24 for 6 months and then she married someone else. He tells you that another girlfriend was married and didn’t tell him, one “went crazy and threatened him with a gun,” and one broke up with him saying that he was “too needy” and “almost obsessive” in wanting to see her every day. He tells you that “all in all, I’m unhappy with how things are going and I need to make changes, but I just have no motivation to do it and I don’t know why I should have to.”","Considering the information provided, which referral should you make first for this client before any other?",Refer him to a psychiatrist for evaluation and medication management,Refer him to a psychologist for mental health testing prior to beginning treatment,Refer him to his family physician for a complete physical,Refer him to a community group to help build relationships,Refer him to his family physician for a complete physical,"Counselors are not medical experts but are expected to recognize physical symptoms of stress and substance use that may need to be evaluated. The client complains of increasing stress and substance use, as well as recent chest and shoulder pain, which should be evaluated by a medical professional prior to beginning a course of treatment that may increase the client's stress. The client does not currently need referral to psychology or psychiatry. Licensed counselors in most states have the ability to determine diagnosis and treat without oversight. Clients with BPD may sometimes be treated with medications but while the client is using recreational substances and pain medication, other medications should not be recommended. If the client is interested in medication for treatment of BPD and is willing to discontinue his use of other substances, psychiatry will be an effective future referral. The client's personality traits have made relationships difficult so referral to a group aimed at forming relationships with other healthy adults is not likely to be effective at this time.","Family History:
He states he is close to his sister who has never married but “always likes the deadbeat guys.” He tells you his father and mother never showed affection to him while growing up, were always bickering, and his mother was always obsessive about saving money and always complaining. He acknowledges loving his parents but sometimes getting so angry at them that he wishes he could just ignore them forever. He tells you both his maternal and paternal grandfathers were “mean as snakes,” while his paternal grandmother was a “saint.” He reports that one of his uncles committed suicide several years ago and that his cousin, whom he was very close to, committed suicide last year.

BPD is a personality disorder that centers around the anxiety of being rejected and abandoned, which this client appears to have experienced often. Because the client shows little insight into himself and his thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, helping him to distinguish between when he doesn't care and when he doesn't actually care and when he feels too anxious to attempt caring, will help him better understanding his feelings. Teaching the client about the causes and familial links of BPD may influence him to focus on others and how he has been harmed, rather than on his own current problems. The fact that BPD tends to decline with age may be hopeful news but may also encourage ambivalence as the client is already unmotivated to make changes in himself. Finally, the BPD client may make suicidal threats to prevent abandonment, but the threats are also indicators of the pain the individual is experiencing. It will be helpful at some point to discuss his threats and manipulative behaviors, but this would not be a priority at the beginning of treatment and may make the client feel defensive.","Family History:

This causes the individual to have difficulty making decisions and knowing which feeling to follow. The anxiety of ambivalence makes it easier for the individual to disregard engaging with emotions in order to lessen the anxiety. Because of his ambivalence, the client is least likely to follow through with journaling about his emotions outside of sessions and this would cause him to encounter the duality of emotions that are stressful for him. A better process would be to educate the client on ambivalence and how it can be normal and healthy, but when it becomes chronic, it can become debilitating. Helping the client name and identify different emotions and how he might know when he experiences them would then be helpful for the client who avoids emotions. Concentrating on where in his body he feels specific emotions will provide him with a way to distinguish which emotion he is feeling in the moment.","Family History:

This sense of entitlement demonstrates a tendency to see people as objects rather than individuals with their own needs, feelings, and perspectives. Role playing with the client can teach him how to listen and observe others in order to view them as people separate from him but still in relationship with him. Having the client list why or why not women are ""nuts or evil"" could be a good practice in helping him to see how he generalizes feelings about some women into all women. This may be helpful at another time but at this time, is not as important as helping relate to others to whom he has connections, such as in his current relationship. Relaxation exercises are helpful for managing negative emotions, but in this session, helping him control his emotions takes the focus away from the content that triggered his feelings. Empty chair exercises, like relaxation exercises, may be helpful later but currently it refocuses the session away from the triggering content that will be best processed immediately.","Family History:

He is dressed professionally and appropriately to the circumstances as he tells you he will see clients after your appointment. The client lays on the office couch with his hands behind his head and his feet on a cushion. He answers questions without pauses and often replies very casually with “sure” or “I don’t know,” demonstrating little insight into his thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. He estimates his mood as dissatisfied and unhappy though his affect suggests ambivalence. He presents with some complaints of forgetfulness but is oriented to time and place, and endorses no delusions or hallucinations. He acknowledges frequently feeling suspicious, especially when he’s feeling really stressed. He says he questions other people’s motives and what they are doing or saying when he’s not present. The client acknowledges using alcohol on weekends, and has used marijuana and cocaine regularly over the past ten years but admits it has increased over the last two years. He assures you he only drinks and uses drugs when not seeing clients. He has a prescription for pain medicine and states he uses it appropriately.","You are a counselor in a private practice setting.  Your client presents with complaints of not meeting his own expectations in his licensed, health care profession, and dealing with the business aspect of his work, difficulty meeting financial obligations, difficulty getting along with others, and problems with his ability to concentrate. He says his business partner used to be his best friend but now he can’t stand him because he sees the clients more often and leaves your client to do all the work. He tells you his concentration issues have always been present but have become progressively worse over the past eighteen months, as have his feelings of irritability, failure, fatigue, and lately he has pains in his chest and shoulder. He tells you that he thinks sometimes about what would happen if he died, but only as far as wondering how others would react. Later in the session, he says he is not suicidal and does not have a plan, but occasionally he just “gets tired of it all.” He tells you that sometimes he feels like “ending it” and has said that to women when the relationship isn’t going well and once or twice during breakups. He asserts that he has not actually tried to kill himself. He summarizes his relationships with others as “if they like me, they lose interest” and says that he finds himself “almost being manipulative” in how he chooses his words in his relationships with women and sometimes takes them on spontaneous “wildly expensive vacations” so they will not lose interest in him. The client tells you he has been in several relationships with women over the years, beginning with his high school sweetheart, then with his college sweetheart, but none of them have “worked out.” He states he was engaged to his college sweetheart at 24 for 6 months and then she married someone else.

Determining if the client feels safe working with the counselor to build new relational skills and whether they want to continue with treatment, is the best way to determine if counseling is effective at this time. Additionally, the counselor will be able to observe very small changes even though they may not be consistent. The MMPI2 will help diagnose a personality disorder but will not show changes or improvement in the diagnosis. Personality disorders are long-lasting personality characteristics that are used to interact with others, and research shows that it takes time for clients to make significant changes. Asking the client to survey others will put him in a vulnerable position with those he believes may reject him or who may not see changes in him, which could lead to increased ambivalence and anxiety. Counseling efficacy should always be discussed with clients to determine if their experience with the counselor is successful at meeting their goals.","Family History:

She appears overweight for height as noted in her intake. Her mood and affect are congruent and she appears to be cooperative and forthcoming in her responses. She demonstrates no retardation, spasticity, or hyperactivity of motor activity. She is oriented and demonstrates no unusual thought processes or patterns. Her insight is intact and she identifies goals for therapy. She reports no suicidal ideations, thoughts of harm to self or others, or difficulties with memory, judgement, or concentration. ","You are a counselor in a community agency that provides counseling.  Your client presents with a history of convictions for felony criminal offenses in her early 20s, of weight loss and gains since college, and currently rates herself as approximately 50 pounds overweight. She describes herself in years past as “fat,” “ugly,” and “grotesque.” She reports one long term relationship during high school and college, with a male she tells you was “manipulative, controlling, and emotionally abusive. She reports not “dating-dating” since their break up six years ago. She does report that recently she has engaged in self-destructive behaviors with different people in the context of online relationships. She states that in several cases, she has met men and women online and used elaborate methods, including using multiple telephone numbers and creating false names and life events to establish relationships with these individuals. Several relationships ended abruptly when the individuals, both male and female, made concerted efforts to meet the client, at which time she disclosed the truth to them. She tells you that she feels very badly about what she did, particularly because she had been helping each of the people with different problems in their lives, including one of the women with an abusive spouse, and she believes now these people will have no help.  She attended counseling for several months three years ago but reports she did not tell the counselor everything. Today she tells you that she is now in a professional graduate program for counseling and wants to be open about everything so she can “finally get her life in order.”",Which of the following should you discuss with the client in preparation for counseling?,Counseling only works if the client is completely truthful with the counselor.,Counseling is hard work and sometimes she will leave feeling emotionally tired.,Counseling is only effective when the client feels safe enough to be themselves.,Counseling works best if the client commits to weekly sessions in the first few months.,Counseling is only effective when the client feels safe enough to be themselves.,"Research has shown that the therapeutic relationship between client and counselor is the most important element in effective counseling. When the client feels safe enough to be themselves, they will, in the therapy room, act in the same ways that they interact with others, which allows the counselor to help them look at their interpersonal style and skills. As a result, the client can choose new ways to think, feel, and behave. It is true that counseling is hard, clients will sometimes leave tired, and counseling can move faster if clients attend weekly at first. The latter is not a requirement for effective counseling however and slower gains are still beneficial. Counseling is easier and may work more effectively if a client is truthful with the counselor but it is not necessary. Clients may tell their stories from a skewed perspective and the truth they tell may not be what actually occurred. Counselors are trained to observe clients and through empathic attunement and responses may help clients work on ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving without knowing the full circumstances about an event.","Family History:

She tells you she daily engaged in binging and purging from age 13 to age 20, but never told anyone or saw a doctor for this. She tells you that she has not binge/purged for the past five years.

The PAI assesses personality and psychopathology and shows convergent validity with the MMPI-2. The client is in school currently but no educational issues are mentioned in the intake so the KTEA-3 is not appropriate. The BDI-II will provide information on the client's current emotional health related to possible depression, but as a stand-alone test, it will not provide the counselor with enough information to ascertain this client's overall counseling needs. The EI is used for evaluating current or past eating disorders. This is a good tool to use if the client's eating disorder is the subject of counseling. Because the client has never received a diagnosis, has never been treated for Bulimia Nervosa, and has been able to self-control her urges, this test would not be helpful at this time.","Family History:

These include the acts of binging and purging, at least once a week for 3 months. Based on her descriptive comments about her weight and self-image, she meets criterion C as her self-evaluation was unduly influenced by her body weight and shape. Because she has not engaged in the binge-purge cycle for 5 years, she merits the specifier, In Full Remission. The assessment shows a significant elevation in antisocial acts, which is expected due to her past criminal history, but no elevations in egocentricity or stimulation-seeking. A diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder would require elevations in all three areas. Additionally, her score on the total Antisocial scale is within 10 points of the Mean, which is not clinically significant. The client may have demonstrated some traits in the past of a narcissistic personality disorder such as a grandiose sense of self-importance, desiring excessive admiration, and is interpersonally exploitative as indicated by her criminal history and the people she interacted with using false personas. However, she does not meet the required five criteria for diagnosis as she shows remorse and insight of her past actions, which is not characteristic of someone with this personality disorder.

Individuals with a fragile self-esteem or sense of identity (i.e., such as narcissists) have difficulty with insight into their own emotions. Making an observation of what the counselor is observing opens up an opportunity to begin processing emotions with the content. Asking the client to determine where to start allows the client to direct the session, but if the client is struggling with connecting to emotions, the client will be more likely to stay content-focused rather than working therapeutically on process. Making a statement about the client not being ""the good girl"" anymore would likely be received as sarcasm or judgement about the client's actions, rather than listening for the emotions and thoughts underneath the content. Asking about how jail changed her is a good question but if it is asked right now, it changes focus away from the content and difficulty with emotional connection that the client has just demonstrated.

These are usually used with children and adolescents, and it would be unusual to do this with an adult with normal intellectual abilities. As the client has demonstrated willingness to talk with the counselor about her life history, it would be most beneficial to follow a sequential process of introducing the connections between emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, followed by helping the client identify feelings she has experienced. Counselors, with clients' permission, may record or have the client record their narrative so that the recording can be used in session to process thoughts and emotions that underlie or result from the client's actions.","Family History:

The client is just learning to connect emotions and will likely be anxious at trying to explore such uncomfortable material within herself. Active listening and attending skills show the client that the counselor is present and available to them. This is important in all sessions, although listening and attending postures will not indicate acceptance of the client's attempts at identifying emotions as a non-judgmental stance will do. Reflections of feelings are core skills in which the counselor listens to what a client is saying and allows the counselor to name the feeling that corresponds with or underlies the client's statements (i.e., ""It sounds like you were sad""). Because the purpose of this intervention is to have the client connect her actions to feelings, it is not helpful for the counselor to take that role on instead. Conflict tolerance is a necessary skill for counselors to possess, however based on the information presented, the counselor and client are unlikely to experience conflict in the therapeutic relationship because helping the client identify emotions is done at the client's pace to facilitate a safe and trusting environment.","Family History:

Schizophrenia does not resolve on its own and the client will likely require medication throughout her lifetime. Once she has been evaluated and medication is prescribed, the counselor and parent will notify the school of any concerns regarding the client. Enrolling the client in a social skills group may be helpful after medication has been instituted as she will need to learn skills in communicating appropriately with others while feeling limited by her medication. Medications for schizophrenia have side effects that make it difficult for individuals to engage with others.

Acknowledging that trust and helping the new clinician build that same trust will be important. This may include focusing on times you and the clinician have worked together and your trust in that individual or focusing on the skills that the clients used to build trust with you which they can, in turn, use with the new provider. It is never helpful to position the agency as unyielding or uncaring and that a client's care is just a matter of policy. This engenders distrust of the agency. Additionally, offering to see if the termination can be stopped demonstrates a lack of objectivity on the part of the counselor. When a counselor loses objectivity with a client, a referral is helpful for the client's continued growth. Telling clients that another counselor is better than you, is likely to be received as untruthful, superficial and/or patronizing.","Family History:

He demonstrates positive signs of self-care in his hygiene and dress. He appears to be open and cooperative, with some hesitancy noted in his speech pattern, due to age or possible alcohol use. The client endorsed several positive responses to alcohol dependence but states he has not used alcohol prior to this session. He states he does not take any medication. He identifies his mood as ambivalent and his affect is congruent with little lability. His responses to questions demonstrate appropriate insight, judgement, memory, concentration, and orientation. He does state that he has never considered harming himself, but acknowledges passive ideas such as, “what’s the point,” he would be “better off dead,” or he should “drink a lot of wine and go to sleep.” He acknowledges these as previously unrecognized suicidal ideations and states he does not have a wish or plan to follow through or harm himself.","You are a counselor in a private practice setting.  Your client is a 68-year old male who presents with difficulties stemming from his role as a caregiver to his wife of 26 years and who now has Parkinson’s disease and requires his full attention. He tells you that he has been providing care for the past 40 years, first for his parents and now for his wife.  The client endorses feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, irritability, and being overwhelmed. He states that he has difficulty concentrating, anxious, losing things, and having unwanted thoughts like that he might be better off dead. He tells you also that he has difficulty sleeping and can’t enjoy any hobbies or social activities because of caring for his spouse. The client states that he distracted himself from his negative feelings last year by preparing for the move to their new home and then getting settled in. The client and his wife moved into an assisted living facility, but live in independent housing. The client endorsed a history of alcohol use that includes drinking more than he intends, feeling the need to cut down, being preoccupied with drinking, and using alcohol to relieve emotional pain. He states he drinks one to two bottles of wine daily and has done so for the past 6 years. He acknowledges that he has not admitted the extent of his alcohol use to others and works diligently to hide it. He reports he is unwilling to attend AA or other alcohol support groups, but “lurks” on an online support group for alcoholics. The client tells you that he attended counseling twice: 15 years ago, related to depression about his wife’s diagnosis and 10 years ago related to depression and anxiety related to caregiving. On both occasions, he was prescribed antidepressants but said he refused to fill the prescriptions because he doesn’t like to take medicine.","Considering the provided information, which of the following should be addressed first?",What will be different in counseling this time as opposed to the client's previous therapy,Whether the client would be willing to stop using alcohol so therapy can begin,In what ways does the client think that the counselor will be able to help him,The client's commitment to reducing his alcohol use before the next session,In what ways does the client think that the counselor will be able to help him,It is important for the counselor and client to explore the roles that each takes in counseling. The counselor will gain important information from the client by understanding what the client expects the counselor to help him accomplish.

This allows the counselor to tailor the treatment plan to the stage in which the client currently resides. Motivational Interviewing is an effective way of moving a client into action when they are less motivated to do so or are experiencing resistance. Motivational Interviewing is a good intervention to use after the client's stage of change has been determined. The Motivation Assessment Scale does measure motivation but is used for clients with developmental disabilities. The client's goals may show desires for change but particularly as the client has been in counseling for these same issues in the past, it is not likely that the goals will provide evidence of the client's readiness for change.","Family History:

Inviting the client's wife to the session, even with the client's permission, is not likely to be beneficial as there is no established trust or therapeutic relationship between the counselor and the client's wife. His wife may feel attacked or ganged up on if the counselor advocates for respite care. It would not be unusual for a client to need support in choosing a respite care, however it would be unprofessional for the counselor to accompany the client to help him determine which facility is best. Accompanying him may breach the ethical principles of autonomy (right to self-determination or choice) and nonmaleficence (refraining from taking action that might harm another).","Family History:

Being able to share his feelings with others that are in similar situations will allow him to see that his emotions are normal and he is not alone. Having the client investigate daily activities is most likely to increase his feelings of guilt and anger as he has stated he often has to cancel because of his wife's needs. Scheduling in-home caregivers despite his wife's objections will likely cause more guilt and anger if his wife is not cooperative. Having the client keep a journal of his emotions and thoughts can be helpful for some clients, particularly when clients are trying to identify their emotions. In this client's case, he is aware of his guilt and anger and why he experiences these.

Your client is a 31 year-old female who reports that she is very impatient and feels angry all the time, and is taking it out on her children and others with angry outbursts. She says that her children are good but they don’t pick up when she tells them to and often, they put their toys away in the wrong places. The client states that her husband died while the family was on a vacation. She tells you that they had stopped for a break and her husband was hit by a car.  She says that it happened in front of her and the children, who are now 6 and 7 years old. She endorses feeling angry, restless, and having trouble making decisions. She tells you that she is having trouble falling asleep, is anxious and overwhelmed.

Marrying her husband, who was the best friend of her former boyfriend, is not a cultural factor and may be explored in relation to the client's history, but not as part of the section of the intake that explores the client's cultural formation. Living with a parent who has schizophrenia and another parent who is verbally abusive will shape how the client perceives herself and the world around her. It is unexpected to lose a spouse prior to age 30 and places the client in a cultural category with other young women who have been widowed early in life and will shape the way the client views herself and the world around her.","Family History:

She states he often told the client that any mistakes she made were the reason that their life was so bad. She has no siblings but her husband has two sisters, with whom the client does not engage. She states one of his sisters is living with her boyfriend and the other asked to borrow money from her and her husband, which made the client angry. She identifies her support system as her church and a group of couples whom she and her husband were friends with prior to his death, most of whom attended the client and her husband’s high school and college. The client says she tends to be drawn to overly controlling people and her church, though fundamentalist and legalistic, became like family to her in high school.  She tells you that the couple’s closest friends are her husband’s best friend, whom the client dated in high school, and his wife. She says that while dating, her then boyfriend was very attentive, “almost smothering,” but also very demanding by leaving her notes with things or work he wanted her to do for him.

These patterns may have served the client well in childhood but have become problematic in her adult life. The MMPI-2 is used to assess personality traits and psychopathology. This may help the counselor determine a client's psychological state or a diagnosis, but it will not help explain the client's relationships with others. The BAI-II measures the client's current level of anxiety at a particular moment when the test is given. It is helpful as a pre- and post-test for monitoring anxiety levels, but will not add to the counselor's understanding of the client's relationship patterns with others. The TAT is a projective test that helps the counselor learn more about a client's emotional conflicts, themes within the client's life experience, psychological conditions, and may help the client to express their feelings in an indirect way. It does not provide specific information on the client's relationships with others.","Family History:

Having the client identify how she would know if she was more patient and less angry allows the counselor and client to develop goals that are specific, realistic, and achievable. Asking the client what would make her more patient and less angry is not helpful because if she knew this answer or could achieve it on her own, she would not be seeking help. Asking her to identify some things that make her feel impatient and angry is a helpful question when setting up objectives and interventions so that the counselor and client can choose specific areas to focus on during counseling. Asking the client whether there has been a time where she has been more patient and less angry can help the client and counselor determine if the client needs to build new skills to reach this goal or whether the client has possessed these skills in the past and needs to remember how to use them. This is an important part of planning interventions, but not an important part of setting the treatment goal.","Family History:

It will be most helpful for the counselor and the client to review the signs and criteria for schizophrenia in comparison with the client's symptoms to ease her anxiety. It would not be appropriate to suggest the client form a new support group at this time because the client is already overwhelmed. The counselor has not observed her friend and does not know if the client misperceives her friend's help or that the friend's way of helping is not effective for this client. The client is demonstrating appropriate care and patience for her child during the session. This does not mean that she has been able to modify her emotions and behavior to maintain this change and therefore the goal is not met until that occurs. This would not be the appropriate time to talk about the counselor's suspicions that the client may exhibit traits consistent with a personality disorder because the client is concerned about a possible schizophrenia diagnosis (being ""seen as crazy."")","Family History:
The client reports a significant family history with her mother diagnosed with schizophrenia, with catatonia and was not medicated.

She states he often told the client that any mistakes she made were the reason that their life was so bad. She has no siblings but her husband has two sisters, with whom the client does not engage. She states one of his sisters is living with her boyfriend and the other asked to borrow money from her and her husband, which made the client angry. She identifies her support system as her church and a group of couples whom she and her husband were friends with prior to his death, most of whom attended the client and her husband’s high school and college. The client says she tends to be drawn to overly controlling people and her church, though fundamentalist and legalistic, became like family to her in high school.  She tells you that the couple’s closest friends are her husband’s best friend, whom the client dated in high school, and his wife. She says that while dating, her then boyfriend was very attentive, “almost smothering,” but also very demanding by leaving her notes with things or work he wanted her to do for him. She states they dated for several years and then she met and married his best friend, who was her husband. She tells you that their best friend’s wife is her best friend, although “she irritates me all the time, and I don’t really like her that much.” She says her friend has a strong personality, is controlling, and wants to make all the decisions and plans in their relationship.","(A): The client should consider forming a new support group as her friend is not supportive

Explaining the concept of boundaries and how these can provide protection from others' overcontrol, while learning to recognize when the client is trying to control others is a skill which will assist her in each of the relationships she has brought into the counseling sessions thus far. Conflict resolution is an important skill which will be shared under the concept of boundaries. Currently, the client avoids conflict while giving in to her friends and feeling angry. Teaching conflict resolutions skills will help resolve this problem but will not help her learn to deal with controlling and being controlled. Active listening and attending skills will help the client as she communicates more effectively with others, but will not help her address her anger at being controlled or when she controls others and they do not submit. Relaxation techniques will be helpful for this client to reduce her anger and help her interact with more patience when irritated. This symptom-specific skill is important but will not address the root of her anger, which is caused by the feeling of being controlled or controlling others without their agreement.","Family History:

By playing the role of the in-laws and friend, the client can listen to new ways of responding to those individuals so that she can feel comfortable imitating the counselor in actual conversations. Providing the client with a book on boundaries can be very helpful, if the client follows through with the reading. Clients do not always complete homework, so assigning a book to read may not provide the outcome that the counselor had hoped. Having the client invite her friend to a session may or may not be effective. While it can provide an opportunity for the client to feel safe confronting her friend, her friend may feel uncomfortable and a rupture in the relationship may occur. Teaching the client a grounding technique when her anger overwhelms her is a good intervention to use when the client's emotions are out of control. In most situations, it is best to help clients be proactive in working on their issues rather than concentrating on reactive remedies.","Family History:

He rates his mood as “anxious.” His affect is congruent though he appears to relax as the session continues.  He demonstrates some limited insight and frequently responds with “I don’t know” but when encouraged, is able to access thoughts and emotions that are disturbing to him. He demonstrates appropriate judgment, memory, and orientation. He reports never having considered suicide or harming himself or anyone else. He states that he is very engaged individually and with his family in their religious practices and views these as a source of strength. He currently takes 50 mg of Pristiq and Concerta 18 mg.","You are a counselor in a community agency setting.  Your client is a 53 year-old male who presents with complaints of feeling insignificant, unworthy, and a failure. He admits to having these feelings for the past 30 years and while he has never had suicidal ideations or plans, he has often wondered if his life had purpose and what that purpose was. Your client additionally tells you that he doesn’t feel happy on most days though he does have happy feelings at times; they just don’t last. He is good at his job and finds it challenging, yet tells you “it’s a job” and that there is nothing special or “exciting” about it to him. He tells you that he has been married for twenty years and has five children; three of whom he adopted when he married his wife. He states he adores his wife and children, though he knows that he often does not meet their needs emotionally, “tunes out,” and frequently puts his own “wants and desires” before their requests, needs, or previously made plans. He admits he gets “jealous, I guess” when someone else in the family gets something that he didn’t. He also says that he often says “the wrong thing” when his wife or children are upset about something and he struggles to understand how they are feeling. He tells you that these actions cause conflict in his marriage and with his children and he is ashamed that he does this, but feels hopeless that things will change because he cannot figure out how to change or why he does these things. He reports that he does not believe himself to be better than others but that others often perceive that he sees himself that way because of how he interacts with them. He also tells you that his family often wishes he would “think before I speak or make decisions.” He reports that in spite of these “failures,” he and his wife have a very strong marriage and express their love for each other daily. They enjoy activities together although he needs very active recreation such as roller coasters, bike riding, and swimming while his wife leans towards less physical activities. Finally, your client tells you that over the years he has had some trouble focusing at work and at home. He views himself as “forgetful” and says “I don’t have a good memory.” He says this causes troubles at home and work when he frequently forgets to do something that he said he would do or when he is not as careful or gets distracted in his work and is slow to finish projects or makes small mistakes that have greater impacts on reports.","Based on the information provided, which of the following is most appropriate to discuss with the client during this session?",The limits of confidentiality related to subpoenas by the court,The requirement for release of information to third party providers,The client's rights and responsibilities during counseling,The importance of maintaining documentation for the client's care,The client's rights and responsibilities during counseling,"Discussing the client's rights and responsibilities will be most important during this first session. The client has experienced relationships where he makes obligations and does not keep them, tunes out those whom he may feel conflict with, and avoids self-reflection of emotions and behaviors. Discussing the need for regularly attending counseling sessions and engagement in those sessions will best help the client receive the most from his work in counseling. Explaining the limits of confidentiality are always included in counseling, but specific emphasis in discussion of the limits related to subpoenas is not most important as the client demonstrates no evidence of legal issues at home or work. There are no requirements for releases of information from other providers, though these can be helpful should the client wish to give these permissions. Since there is no requirement, it is not an area that is most important to cover through discussion with this client. Maintenance of documentation during counseling is often covered in intake documents such as Informed Consent and is not most important to cover through discussion.","Family History:
The client reports his parents were married to each other until his father’s death at age 60.

Due to the client's age, this would not be an assessment to use. Because he takes Concerta, the counselor may choose to use an inventory developed for adults. The MMPI-2 is used to assess personality traits and psychopathology. This may help the counselor determine a client's psychological state or a diagnosis, and in this client's case, may help explain some of the patterns that the client exhibits that are not easily fit into a diagnostic category, such as his forgetting, tuning out, and being seen as thinking he is better than others when he does not believe this. Completing and evaluating a family genogram will help the counselor and client identify patterns and interactional dynamics that have become unhealthy ways of thinking and behaving that may have served the client well in childhood with his family of origin but have become problematic in his adult life in his family and other relationships. The BAI-II measures the client's current level of anxiety. The client presents with an anxious mood and takes Pristiq, which is both an antidepressant, and an anti-anxiety medication that works on neurotransmitters that impact the fight-or-flight response.","Family History:

These criteria do not meet the full criteria for NPD and because the client possesses insight to understand that these feelings and behaviors are not appropriate, loving, or who he wishes to be, he possesses NPD Traits, not the full personality disorder diagnosis.

The client's inability to understand another perspective without help and his difficulty expressing regret or remorse are also indicative of people with NPD or narcissistic traits. Because this client possesses insight, it is most helpful to work with him on understanding how his feelings about himself and others' perceptions of him impact his self-esteem. Helping the client to understand his self-esteem as the problematic factor in his relationship with himself and others, will later allow him to work on improving his ability to empathize and acknowledge potential or actual mistakes without injury to his self-esteem.

Self-esteem is developed through early interactions with others, especially one's primary caregivers. Many of the client's current behaviors mimic those he used when relating to his mother, whom he described as extremely critical and not meeting his needs or those of others. It will be helpful to have the client process how his own self-esteem developed and how he internalized strategies to protect himself from self-esteem injuries. Journaling is a helpful process for clients who are able to access emotions and insight as they will often use their writings to begin working out their thoughts and feelings outside of session. This client may benefit from journaling as therapy continues but currently uses protective strategies to prevent self-esteem injuries. Setting and maintaining boundaries is a helpful communication and behavioral skill that the client may benefit from later in counseling to help curb some of his narcissistic traits related to jealousy and entitlement. These are not likely to be helpful at this point in therapy. Using the two-chair method to work through mother-client difficulties maybe helpful in therapy later. At this time, it is most important for the client to begin understanding the relationship and its impact on his personality.","Family History:

The client is making small changes in lifelong personality characteristics and it will be important for the counselor and client to help him identify exactly what he has been doing that is different now. Telling him to keep doing what he is doing does not recognize the progress and does not identify the different steps he is actually making to act differently. Without this information, the client may not know how he has made his recent accomplishments. It will be important to discuss the client's frustration after reviewing his progress and identifying the changes he has made. Since the client and his wife are able to work together through the client's traits and he is able to move from angry and frustrated to feeling ""good"" or satisfied that he has understood where he struggled before, there is no reason to restrict those conversations to therapy sessions. Should the client say that these conversations are making him more upset, causing self-esteem injuries, or are nonproductive, then the counselor might ask if the client would want to restrict them to couple's sessions.","Family History:

Because the client states that she had reading difficulties for years prior to quitting school in 10th grade, this would be the least helpful assessment for this client. The BDI-II measures the client's current level of depression, which is often correlated with symptoms of hoarding. The potential for this client to be experiencing a hoarding disorder is noted in the number of animals she keeps, the amount of vehicles, and other items kept without letting them go. Additionally, hoarding is often related to OCD and ADHD, making the YBOC and Structured Interview for Adult ADHD tests to consider for this client.","Family History:

The client views herself as doing well on her own and being pushed by her family to live differently as a means of taking her property away from her. Setting goals that help the client improve what may or may not be a good living situation honors the client's values while creating space to work together. Asking the client about goals for better care suggests that the client is not taking good care of herself now and may create a sense of distrust in the client if she perceives the counselor as not believing her. Goals related to getting rid of possessions is likely to cause distrust in the client as this is not a goal that she has currently alluded to in the intake. Goals to help the family feel better are not appropriate goals for counseling as they are focused on pleasing someone other than the client.","Family History:

She tells you that she is very happy living alone and is never lonely because she has over 20 indoor and outdoor cats that she feeds and they keep her company. During the intake, the client tells you that her husband of 33 years died five years ago from lung cancer.

Having the client bring a small collection of items to session so that the client and counselor can explore the client's emotions and thought processes surrounding items that have little value but take up space in her home. The empty chair exercise is a helpful intervention to help clients explore relationships. This client has demonstrated limited insight about her hoarding, making an empty chair exercise difficult. Given the client's limited insight into her hoarding, she is not likely to follow through with journaling or find it helpful. Asking the client to discard one item a day is not an effective treatment for hoarding disorder as the difficulty in making decisions about what should go or stay is part of the disorder.","Family History:

Even those with hoarding disorders have the autonomy to choose what they will keep and what they will discard. While the client's possessions may have no value to the counselor or others, they hold significant value for the client and the counselor's empathic response, as the client works through modifying thought, experiencing extreme emotions, and making choices, is critical. Congruence and positive regard are important counseling characteristics with all clients and facilitate the trust needed for the therapeutic relationship. While these are important for that relationship, without empathic responding during the hoarding client's exploration of possessions, change will not occur. Sensitivity to multicultural issues is also an important counseling characteristic with all clients and will help the counselor better understand the client's perceptions of the world and themselves; however, it is not as helpful in supporting the client's work on changes as is empathic responding.","Family History:

He identifies his mood as “anxious but a little excited” because he “is hopeful that he can finally let his anger go.” He tells you he is tired because he has difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep most nights. His affect is pleasant with emotional lability evident. He demonstrates appropriate insight and judgment, memory, and orientation.  He reports never “seriously” having considered suicide but acknowledges that there were times when he wondered “if dying would make this pain go away.” He has never attempted suicide and states he would never consider harming himself or anyone else.","You are a counselor in a private practice setting.  Your client is a 26-year-old male who presents for counseling at the request of his family and his employer, with whom he is close and who knows his history. The client tells you that he has been angry for the past 15 years, beginning a year after the death of his father from a heart attack. He says that his anger is triggered very quickly when frustrated by people or situations and that his “fuse is very short these days.” He states that he has been in some “loud arguments” with his mother, and later his stepfather. He admits that there have been times in the past when he and his stepfather have “almost come to blows” but his mother stepped in and made them stop. He admits to having hit or kicked walls at times in his anger, but has never hit a person. He tells you that he doesn’t want to feel this way because it interferes with his relationships and his former girlfriends have never understood that when the anniversary of his dad’s death comes around, he just wants to be alone for a couple days and not have to talk to anyone. He tells you that he has never had a long-term relationship with a woman because either he gets “depressed” for a few days during certain times of the year (i.e., father’s birthdate and death date) or because he is too quick to get angry and then says things he doesn’t mean. He says that he has been in a relationship with a woman now for eight months and really wants to get himself together because he feels “she’s the one.”","Based on the information provided, which of the following diagnoses should the counselor suspect?",Adjustment Disorder (AD),Major Depressive Disorder (MDD),Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),General Anxiety Disorder (GAD),Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),"The client has met the first criterion for PTSD in that he was exposed to an actual death, by witnessing the event which happened to a close family member (Criterion A). Additionally, his angry outbursts with little provocation and his difficulty falling asleep meet Criterion E, which requires marked alterations in arousal and reactivity. An adjustment disorder could be expected with significant life changes, but the disturbance of an adjustment disorder cannot encapsulate normal bereavement (Criterion D), nor can the client meet criteria for another mental health disorder (Criterion C). Given the time period of 15 years since the event and the client's positive experiences with family since the event, it would not be appropriate to diagnose an adjustment disorder. The client uses the word ""depression"" to describe periods of ""a couple days"" during the year in which he feels sad and isolates himself. MDD requires that the individual have either a depressed mood, most of the day, nearly every day during a two-week period (Criterion A1); or a loss of interest in almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day during a two-week period (Criterion A2). The client does not demonstrate these conditions for more than ""a couple days"" so he does not meet criteria for MDD. Finally, the client does not demonstrate evidence of a general anxiety disorder as he describes no excessive worries or fears related to events or activities (Criterion A).","Family History:

He reports a “great life” with his family and that they regularly spent time together playing, camping, traveling, and “just being a family.” He tells you that he is sure there were occasional arguments but that he doesn’t remember anything significant, except that he had been mad at his dad the night he died because his dad wouldn’t let him stay up late, but that before the client went to bed, he had come down, apologized to his dad, and they had both said “I love you.”  He states his parents had been married for 15 years prior to his father’s death, which occurred when the client was 11 years old. He states his dad died of a heart attack while sleeping, so while he did not see it, he knew something had happened because his mother woke him and his siblings and rushed them over to the next door neighbors’ house. He said that his mother went to the hospital with his father in the ambulance and came home that night to tell him and his siblings that their father had died. He tells you that he and his siblings are still very close and that they now have three much younger siblings born after his mother married his stepfather. He says that he is very close to his mother and stepfather, although he lives three hours away from them. He tells you that he tries to get home for big family events, like birthdays. He states that his stepfather adopted him and his siblings after the wedding and the client loves him very much.

These can include memories, dreams, flashbacks, or exposure cues that trigger intense distress. Fear and anxiety in social situations with the potential of rejection is a required criterion of social anxiety disorder and is not apparent in this client's information. Temper outbursts that are out of proportion with the situation appear as described by the client but he states they began after his father's death, not before. This is a required criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, which must begin before age 10. The client states that prior to his father's death, he did not experience angry outbursts. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety at separation from others is a required criterion for separation anxiety, which can occur in children and adults following a trauma; however, the client lives at a distance from his family but provides no indication of anxiety or fear related to separation from them.","Family History:

This allows them to revisit past traumatic memories without dissociating. Having the client focus only on their past experiences instead of keeping part of their mind in the present may cause a dissociative break or extreme emotional outburst that can cause the client further emotional injury. Grounding skills will not help prevent intrusive memories or flashbacks from occurring, but these techniques can help the client who experiences either of these to lessen the disturbance through connecting to where they are in the present.","Family History:

Shorter sessions would not allow the client and counselor to work with disturbing emotional content and still have time to help the client recover from these before the session is over. Container exercises are helpful techniques that allow the client to place their intense emotions in a real or imagined container that will hold these until the next session. Having the client select a word or hand motion that signals the counselor that they need a break because of intense emotions allows the counselor to help the client ground themselves and take time to recover before proceeding again. Teaching and practicing breathing exercises are helpful tools for clients to use when they are overwhelmed with intense emotions. Concentrating on their breathing and relaxing each part of their body distracts the mind from the emotions and allows the client to feel more in control.,"Family History:

As the client's symptoms of PTSD subside, he will be better able to connect with normal emotions of grief and loss. PTSD can be associated with MDD, however, the client has described not feeling sad most days, which is a requirement (Criterion A) for an MDD diagnosis. The limbic system is controlled by hormone release and as the client works through his anger, hormones that control ""fight or flight"" such as cortisol, will be released less often into the system inducing normal function, rather than creating new defense mechanisms. While crying can certainly be a reaction to trauma, this client has not experienced that reaction and is reporting crying more now that he is beginning to feel better and less angry. These facts suggest that crying is not a symptom of his PTSD and is occurring as a result of working through his trauma.","Family History:

Individuals with persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) often exhibit difficulty with this process (Criterion C.3).

Thus, responses b, c, and d are not helpful interventions. Journaling and contemplating life events his father missed or how his life might have been different is more likely to trigger emotions related to dissatisfaction, frustration, and anger rather than acceptance of the loss.

Helping the client embrace the individuality of the grief process is both positive and negative. The client has spent 15 years in a grief process that has been ineffective and emotionally harmful due to the trauma involved in his loss. While grief is experienced differently by individuals, there are emotions and actions that are not helpful in resolving grief, which has been exemplified in this case study. Surveying friends provides information on the different ways families, individuals, and cultures grieve, but will not take into account the client's unique situation, the nature of his grief, or the ways that the client may have seen others in his family grieve well. Traditions for grieving are helpful for clients as they share those traditions with others in their culture and allow people to grieve together rather than in isolation. Many individuals may find a workbook or other structured guide helpful for grieving and learning about grief. While helpful, workbooks or guides are generic in structure and are not able to capture each individuals' specific grief story and needs.

Research shows that ADHD shows a high comorbidity for some personality disorders such as OCPD. Response a is incorrect because the client has not demonstrated any symptoms related to bipolar I disorder such as being more talkative ""than usual,"" inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep, or involvement in high-risk activities. Response b is incorrect as there are no symptoms presented that are congruent with an intellectual disability. The client has completed college and owns his own business.

Often genograms can include significant others with whom the client frequently interacts so these relationships can also be examined. The genogram will help the client and counselor examine how the client interacts with others and patterns that may be helpful or unhelpful for him. A history of OCPD behaviors will show up in a genogram as the counselor and client explore patterns of interacting with others. An attachment style assessment will help the counselor understand the client's experience with early primary caregivers and how that relationship may be replicated in his romantic relationship with his wife. This is helpful information but does not provide the breadth of material that a genogram will provide based on the client's difficulties relating to others including his wife, stepchildren, employees, and friends. The Y-BOCS is an assessment for OCD, while this client shows more affinity towards traits of OCPD (preoccupation with details, rules, order, and organization; perfectionism; excessive devotion to work to the exclusion of leisure activity). A family session for observation would not be helpful in building therapeutic rapport as the family focus would likely be on describing how the client's behaviors make the family feel that they cannot meet his expectations. A family or couple session may be more helpful once treatment has begun to help provide a supportive environment for the client while he attempts to make changes.","Family History:

Emotions and expressions of emotionality interfere with the rigidity of the OCPD client. The need to control one's self and environment requires the OCPD client to use logic rather than emotions as the latter leave the OCPD individual vulnerable to rejection if he or she does not respond with perfection. This can lead to individuals with OCPD appearing socially awkward, cold, and unfeeling about others' needs. Psychodynamic therapy helps the OCPD client learn to identify, explore, and express their emotions through increasing self-awareness and insight. Individuals with OCPD do not focus on emotions over the end results of a task and the individual will be more focused on perfection than task completion (Criterion 2). Additionally, individuals with OCPD rarely delegate tasks to others, instead completing themselves, unless the other agrees to do a task exactly how the individual with OCPD has instructed (Criterion 6).","Family History:

The client tells you that he has had friends tell him in the past that he is “OCD” and sometimes his employees make fun of him because he wants everything done a certain way.

The client's tolerance for lack of perfection in others will be triggered when at some point the counselor, like others in the client's life, will behave or say something that violates the client's rigid standards or expectations for perfection. Violating the client's expectation for perfection from the therapist is frequently the cause for OCPD clients to terminate counseling. Forewarning the client of this provides the opportunity to talk about how staying in the therapeutic relationship can help him learn to manage the conflict. Using a feeling wheel or list will not be helpful with the OCPD client because increasing his self-awareness and insight will be needed before he is able to begin working through emotions. Likewise, looking at and understanding others' perspectives may be attempted but the client will eventually need to challenge his own perspectives of his way being the only right one, rather than focusing on others. Prolonged exposure is an effective treatment for OCD, but is not effective in treating OCPD.","Family History:

Additionally, by using the term, ""the rules,"" it allows the client to focus on the rules as separate from himself instead of viewing himself as bad. This statement also provides the client an opportunity to hear that his dilemma is happening inside himself and allows him to react to the statement using the insight he appears to be developing. Asking the client ""why"" may make the client feel attacked and that he needs to defend his rules and why they are important. This is not helpful for the therapeutic relationship.

Exploring his earliest memories of trying to be perfect will help him link his past experiences with his present thoughts and behaviors, which can help him develop greater insight and self-awareness. Exploring the client's anger and sadness is not helpful in the session because clients with OCPD struggle with emotionality. Until the client has built sufficient insight and self-awareness, the client will avoid emotionality as it conflicts with his logic and rule adherence. Asking the client why he didn't do the job himself perpetuates the idea that the client should not delegate tasks without the assurance that his rules will be followed. This is not helpful in reducing the client's OCPD thoughts and behaviors. Exploring how the client will do it differently next time is not a helpful intervention because the client has not yet learned that the rigid and inflexible nature of his rules is what causes his dilemma, rather than other people who refuse to follow them.","Family History:

The counselor must demonstrate respect for the client and her culture. Cultural beliefs about discussing family matters with strangers vary. This client's original intent for counseling was to seek career help, not discuss family issues. It would be necessary for the counselor to allow the client to determine what topics will be discussed in sessions. Asking the client what scares her most makes the assumption that she wishes to discuss her family dilemma more deeply (as noted above) and that she feels scared. It is important for counselors to allow clients to identify their emotions rather than have the counselor assign emotions based on the counselor's own feelings. Asking the client if she can both send money and have time to choose a career demonstrates the counselor's countertransference and need to fix the client's problem, rather than allowing the client to choose her own solutions. Response d is less obtrusive but still does not take the client's culture into account nor allows the client to decide if this will be a topic of counseling. As well, the statement demonstrates the counselor's lack of awareness of her own need to fix the problem.","Family History:

These techniques are non-directive and allow the client to feel listened to and valued. Reframing with this client is not likely to be effective at this time as she wrestles with cultural expectations. Reframing allows the counselor to provide a different perspective of a problem, but when culture is involved, the counselor is more likely to offer a perspective that may not take culture into account. Self-disclosure is one of the least used interventions because counselors must weigh whether the self-disclosure is more for the counselor's benefit or the client's. With this client, self-disclosure would not be appropriate, particularly if the counselor and client do not share the same culture, as any comparisons would not be similar due to differing cultural beliefs. Here-and-now interactions are useful when working on process versus content as they focus on metacommunication. In this case, the counselor must be careful not to make assumptions about what is said or not said because of the cultural differences between the client and the counselor.","Family History:

This will help the counselor and client form a treatment plan to manage the client's stress and any future panic attacks. The counselor should not ask about the client's parents and how she managed that issue. Since the client has not brought it up, the counselor may likely be indulging the counselor's own curiosity, rather than asking for therapeutic reasons. Having the client describe how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed will be addressed in the session as the counselor and client develop treatment strategies for maintaining the client's well-being. Stress and feeling overwhelmed in the moment when embarking on a new venture, such as graduate school, is not abnormal and should not be pathologized. However, because the client states she had a panic attack and has a history of panic attacks, it will be important to address the panic attacks first and then work backwards to feelings of stress. Asking the client why her books triggered a panic attack will not be a helpful question. Panic attacks are triggered by content that may or may not have connection to the actual panic. Asking why the books were a trigger is not important to understanding the panic attack.","Family History:

Integrity vs despair occurs in later adulthood when the individual has not yet accepted death but is beginning to develop a point of view about it. Generativity vs. stagnation is a stage that occurs in middle adulthood. Developmental tasks include parenting, nurturing of adult relationships and the management of career and household.The immortality vs. extinction stage was added by Joan Erikson for persons over 75 years of age.",,"(A): Intimacy vs. isolation
